around the world in  days by jules vernearound the world in eighty dayschapter iin which phileas fogg and passepartout accept each otherthe one as master the other as manmr phileas fogg lived in  at no  saville row burlingtongardens the house in which sheridan died in   he was one ofthe most noticeable members of the reform club though he seemedalways to avoid attracting attention an enigmatical personageabout whom little was known except that he was a polished manof the world  people said that he resembled byronat leastthat his head was byronic but he was a bearded tranquil byronwho might live on a thousand years without growing oldcertainly an englishman it was more doubtful whether phileas foggwas a londoner  he was never seen on change nor at the banknor in the countingrooms of the city no ships ever came intolondon docks of which he was the owner he had no public employmenthe had never been entered at any of the inns of court either at the templeor lincolns inn or grays inn nor had his voice ever resoundedin the court of chancery or in the exchequer or the queens benchor the ecclesiastical courts  he certainly was not a manufacturernor was he a merchant or a gentleman farmer  his name was strangeto the scientific and learned societies and he never was knownto take part in the sage deliberations of the royal institutionor the london institution the artisans association or theinstitution of arts and sciences  he belonged in factto none of the numerous societies which swarm in the english capitalfrom the harmonic to that of the entomologists founded mainlyfor the purpose of abolishing pernicious insectsphileas fogg was a member of the reform and that was allthe way in which he got admission to this exclusive clubwas simple enoughhe was recommended by the barings with whom he had an open credithis cheques were regularly paid at sight from his account currentwhich was always flushwas phileas fogg rich  undoubtedly  but those who knew himbest could not imagine how he had made his fortune and mr foggwas the last person to whom to apply for the information  he wasnot lavish nor on the contrary avaricious for whenever he knewthat money was needed for a noble useful or benevolent purposehe supplied it quietly and sometimes anonymously  he was in shortthe least communicative of men  he talked very little and seemedall the more mysterious for his taciturn manner  his daily habitswere quite open to observation but whatever he did was so exactlythe same thing that he had always done before that the witsof the curious were fairly puzzledhad he travelled  it was likely for no one seemed to knowthe world more familiarly there was no spot so secludedthat he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with ithe often corrected with a few clear words the thousand conjecturesadvanced by members of the club as to lost and unheardof travellerspointing out the true probabilities and seeming as if gifted witha sort of second sight so often did events justify his predictionshe must have travelled everywhere at least in the spiritit was at least certain that phileas fogg had not absented himselffrom london for many years  those who were honoured by a betteracquaintance with him than the rest declared that nobody couldpretend to have ever seen him anywhere else  his sole pastimeswere reading the papers and playing whist  he often won at this gamewhich as a silent one harmonised with his nature but his winningsnever went into his purse being reserved as a fund for his charitiesmr fogg played not to win but for the sake of playingthe game was in his eyes a contest a struggle with a difficultyyet a motionless unwearying struggle congenial to his tastesphileas fogg was not known to have either wife or childrenwhich may happen to the most honest people either relativesor near friends which is certainly more unusual  he lived alonein his house in saville row whither none penetrated  a singledomestic sufficed to serve him  he breakfasted and dined at the clubat hours mathematically fixed in the same room at the same tablenever taking his meals with other members much less bringinga guest with him and went home at exactly midnight only to retireat once to bed  he never used the cosy chambers which the reformprovides for its favoured members  he passed ten hours out of thetwentyfour in saville row either in sleeping or making his toiletwhen he chose to take a walk it was with a regular step in theentrance hall with its mosaic flooring or in the circular gallerywith its dome supported by twenty red porphyry ionic columnsand illumined by blue painted windows  when he breakfasted or dinedall the resources of the clubits kitchens and pantriesits buttery and dairyaided to crowd his table with their mostsucculent stores he was served by the gravest waitersin dress coats and shoes with swanskin soles who profferedthe viands in special porcelain and on the finest linenclub decanters of a lost mould contained his sherryhis port and his cinnamonspiced claret while his beverageswere refreshingly cooled with ice brought at great costfrom the american lakesif to live in this style is to be eccentric it must beconfessed that there is something good in eccentricitythe mansion in saville row though not sumptuous was exceedingly comfortablethe habits of its occupant were such as to demand but little from thesole domestic but phileas fogg required him to be almost superhumanlyprompt and regular  on this very nd of october he had dismissedjames forster because that luckless youth had brought him shavingwaterat eightyfour degrees fahrenheit instead of eightysixand he was awaiting his successor who was due at the housebetween eleven and halfpastphileas fogg was seated squarely in his armchair his feet close togetherlike those of a grenadier on parade his hands resting on his kneeshis body straight his head erect he was steadily watching a complicatedclock which indicated the hours the minutes the seconds the daysthe months and the years  at exactly halfpast eleven mr fogg wouldaccording to his daily habit quit saville row and repair to the reforma rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment wherephileas fogg was seated and james forster the dismissed servant appearedthe new servant said hea young man of thirty advanced and bowedyou are a frenchman i believe asked phileas fogg and your name is johnjean if monsieur pleases replied the newcomer jean passepartouta surname which has clung to me because i have a natural aptnessfor going out of one business into another  i believe im honestmonsieur but to be outspoken ive had several trades  ive beenan itinerant singer a circusrider when i used to vault like leotardand dance on a rope like blondin  then i got to be a professor of gymnasticsso as to make better use of my talents and then i was a sergeant firemanat paris and assisted at many a big fire  but i quitted francefive years ago and wishing to taste the sweets of domestic lifetook service as a valet here in england  finding myself out of placeand hearing that monsieur phileas fogg was the most exact and settledgentleman in the united kingdom i have come to monsieur in the hopeof living with him a tranquil life and forgetting even the nameof passepartoutpassepartout suits me responded mr fogg  you are well recommendedto me i hear a good report of you

in my servicephileas fogg got up took his hat in his left hand put it onhis head with an automatic motion and went off without a wordpassepartout heard the street door shut once it was his newmaster going out  he heard it shut again it was his predecessorjames forster departing in his turn  passepartout remainedalone in the house in saville rowchapter iiin which passepartout is convinced that he has at last found his idealfaith muttered passepartout somewhat flurried ive seen peopleat madame tussauds as lively as my new mastermadame tussauds people let it be said are of wax and are muchvisited in london speech is all that is wanting to make them humanduring his brief interview with mr fogg passepartout had been carefully observing him  he appeared to be a man about forty years of agewith fine handsome features and a tall wellshaped figurehis hair and whiskers were light his forehead compact and unwrinkledhis face rather pale his teeth magnificent  his countenance possessedin the highest degree what physiognomists call repose in actiona quality of those who act rather than talk  calm and phlegmaticwith a clear eye mr fogg seemed a perfect type of that englishcomposure which angelica kauffmann has so skilfully represented on canvasseen in the various phases of his daily life he gave the idea of beingperfectly wellbalanced as exactly regulated as a leroy chronometerphileas fogg was indeed exactitude personified and this was betrayedeven in the expression of his very hands and feet for in men as well asin animals the limbs themselves are expressive of the passionshe was so exact that he was never in a hurry was always readyand was economical alike of his steps and his motions  he never tookone step too many and always went to his destination by the shortest cuthe made no superfluous gestures and was never seen to be moved or agitatedhe was the most deliberate person in the world yet always reached hisdestination at the exact momenthe lived alone and so to speak outside of every social relationand as he knew that in this world account must be taken of frictionand that friction retards he never rubbed against anybodyas for passepartout he was a true parisian of paris  since hehad abandoned his own country for england taking service as a valethe had in vain searched for a master after his own heartpassepartout was by no means one of those pert dunces depicted bymoliere with a bold gaze and a nose held high in the air he wasan honest fellow with a pleasant face lips a trifle protrudingsoftmannered and serviceable with a good round head such as onelikes to see on the shoulders of a friend  his eyes were bluehis complexion rubicund his figure almost portly and wellbuilthis body muscular and his physical powers fully developed by theexercises of his younger days  his brown hair was somewhat tumbledfor while the ancient sculptors are said to have known eighteen methodsof arranging minervas tresses passepartout was familiar with but one ofdressing his own three strokes of a largetooth comb completed his toiletit would be rash to predict how passepartouts lively nature would agreewith mr fogg  it was impossible to tell whether the new servantwould turn out as absolutely methodical as his master requiredexperience alone could solve the question  passepartout had beena sort of vagrant in his early years and now yearned for reposebut so far he had failed to find it though he had already servedin ten english houses  but he could not take root in any of thesewith chagrin he found his masters invariably whimsical and irregularconstantly running about the country or on the lookout for adventurehis last master young lord longferry member of parliamentafter passing his nights in the haymarket taverns was too oftenbrought home in the morning on policemens shoulders  passepartoutdesirous of respecting the gentleman whom he served ventured a mildremonstrance on such conduct which being illreceived he took his leavehearing that mr phileas fogg was looking for a servant and that his lifewas one of unbroken regularity that he neither travelled nor stayedfrom home overnight he felt sure that this would be the place he was afterhe presented himself and was accepted as has been seenat halfpast eleven then passepartout found himself alone inthe house in saville row  he begun its inspection without delayscouring it from cellar to garret  so clean wellarrangedsolemn a mansion pleased him  it seemed to him like a snails shelllighted and warmed by gas which sufficed for both these purposeswhen passepartout reached the second story he recognised at oncethe room which he was to inhabit and he was well satisfied with itelectric bells and speakingtubes afforded communication withthe lower stories while on the mantel stood an electric clockprecisely like that in mr foggs bedchamber both beatingthe same second at the same instant  thats good thatll dosaid passepartout to himselfhe suddenly observed hung over the clock a card which upon inspectionproved to be a programme of the daily routine of the houseit comprised all that was required of the servant from eight in the morningexactly at which hour phileas fogg rose till halfpast elevenwhen he left the house for the reform cluball the details of servicethe tea and toast at twentythree minutes past eight the shavingwaterat thirtyseven minutes past nine and the toilet at twenty minutes before teneverything was regulated and foreseen that was to be done fromhalfpast eleven am till midnight the hour at which themethodical gentleman retiredmr foggs wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best tasteeach pair of trousers coat and vest bore a numberindicating the time of year and season at which they werein turn to be laid out for wearing and the same systemwas applied to the masters shoes  in short the housein saville row which must have been a very temple of disorderand unrest under the illustrious but dissipated sheridan was cosinesscomfort and method idealised  there was no study nor were there bookswhich would have been quite useless to mr fogg for at the reformtwo libraries one of general literature and the other of law and politicswere at his service  a moderatesized safe stood in his bedroomconstructed so as to defy fire as well as burglars but passepartoutfound neither arms nor hunting weapons anywhere everything betrayedthe most tranquil and peaceable habitshaving scrutinised the house from top to bottom he rubbed his handsa broad smile overspread his features and he said joyfullythis is just what i wanted  ah we shall get on togethermr fogg and i  what a domestic and regular gentlemana real machine well i dont mind serving a machinechapter iiiin which a conversation takes place which seems likely to costphileas fogg dearphileas fogg having shut the door of his house at halfpast eleven andhaving put his right foot before his left five hundred and seventyfive times and his left footbefore his right five hundred and seventysix times reached the reform cluban imposing edifice in pall mall which could not have cost less thanthree millions  he repaired at once to the diningroom the nine windowsof which open upon a tasteful garden where the trees were already gildedwith an autumn colouring and took his place at the habitual tablethe cover of which had already been laid for him  his breakfast consistedof a sidedish a broiled fish with reading sauce a scarlet slice ofroast beef garnished with mushrooms a rhubarb and gooseberry tartand a morsel of cheshire cheese the whole being washed down withseveral cups of tea for which the reform is famous  he rose atthirteen minutes to one and directed his steps towards the large halla sumptuous apartment adorned with lavishlyframed paintingsa flunkey handed him an uncut times which he proceeded to cutwith a skill which betrayed familiarity with this delicate operationthe perusal of this paper absorbed phileas fogg until a quarter before fourwhilst the standard his next task occupied him till the dinner hourdinner passed as breakfast had done and mr fogg reappeared in thereadingroom and sat down to the pall mall at twenty minutes before sixhalf an hour later several members of the reform came in and drew upto the fireplace where a coal fire was steadily burningthey were mr foggs usual partners at whist andrew stuart an engineerjohn sullivan and samuel fallentin bankers thomas flanagan a brewerand gauthier ralph one of the directors of the bank of englandall rich and highly respectable personages even in a club whichcomprises the princes of english trade and financewell ralph said thomas flanagan what about that robberyoh replied stuart the bank will lose the moneyon the contrary broke in ralph i hope we may put our handson the robber  skilful detectives have been sent to all theprincipal ports of america and the continent and hellbe a clever fellow if he slips through their fingersbut have you got the robbers description asked stuartin the first place he is no robber at all returned ralph positivelywhat a fellow who makes off with fiftyfive thousand pounds no robbernoperhaps hes a manufacturer thenthe daily telegraph says that he is a gentlemanit was phileas fogg whose head now emerged from behind his newspapers whomade this remark  he bowed to his friends and entered into the conversationthe affair which formed its subject and which was town talk had occurredthree days before at the bank of england  a package of banknotes to thevalue of fiftyfive thousand pounds had been taken from the principalcashiers table that functionary being at the moment engaged in registeringthe receipt of three shillings and sixpence  of course he could not havehis eyes everywhere  let it be observed that the bank of england reposesa touching confidence in the honesty of the public  there are neither guardsnor gratings to protect its treasures gold silver banknotes are freelyexposed at the mercy of the first comer  a keen observer of english customsrelates that being in one of the rooms of the bank one day he had thecuriosity to examine a gold ingot weighing some seven or eight poundshe took it up scrutinised it passed it to his neighbour he to the next manand so on until the ingot going from hand to hand was transferred to the endof a dark entry nor did it return to its place for half an hour  meanwhilethe cashier had not so much as raised his head  but in the present instancethings had not gone so smoothly  the package of notes not being found whenfive oclock sounded from the ponderous clock in the drawing officethe amount was passed to the account of profit and loss  as soon asthe robbery was discovered picked detectives hastened off to liverpoolglasgow havre suez brindisi new york and other ports inspired bythe proffered reward of two thousand pounds and five per cent on the sumthat might be recovered  detectives were also charged with narrowly watchingthose who arrived at or left london by rail and a judicial examinationwas at once entered uponthere were real grounds for supposing as the daily telegraph saidthat the thief did not belong to a professional band  on the dayof the robbery a welldressed gentleman of polished mannersand with a welltodo air had been observed going to and froin the paying room where the crime was committed  a descriptionof him was easily procured and sent to the detectives and somehopeful spirits of whom ralph was one did not despair of his apprehensionthe papers and clubs were full of the affair and everywhere people werediscussing the probabilities of a successful pursuit and the reform clubwas especially agitated several of its members being bank officialsralph would not concede that the work of the detectives was likelyto be in vain for he thought that the prize offered would greatlystimulate their zeal and activity  but stuart was far from sharingthis confidence and as they placed themselves at the whisttablethey continued to argue the matter  stuart and flanagan played togetherwhile phileas fogg had fallentin for his partner  as the game proceededthe conversation ceased excepting between the rubbers when it revived againi maintain said stuart that the chances are in favour of thethief who must be a shrewd fellowwell but where can he fly to asked ralph  no country is safe for himpshawwhere could he go thenoh i dont know that  the world is big enoughit was once said phileas fogg in a low tone  cut sirhe added handing the cards to thomas flanaganthe discussion fell during the rubber after which stuart took up its threadwhat do you mean by once  has the world grown smallercertainly returned ralph  i agree with mr fogg  the worldhas grown smaller since a man can now go round it ten times more quicklythan a hundred years ago  and that is why the search for this thiefwill be more likely to succeedand also why the thief can get away more easilybe so good as to play mr stuart said phileas foggbut the incredulous stuart was not convinced and when thehand was finished said eagerly you have a strange way ralphof proving that the world has grown smaller  so because youcan go round it in three monthsin eighty days interrupted phileas foggthat is true gentlemen added john sullivan  only eighty daysnow that the section between rothal and allahabad on thegreat indian peninsula railway has been openedhere is the estimate made by the daily telegraph from london to suez via mont cenis and   brindisi by rail and steamboats    days from suez to bombay

railsreplied stuart suppose they stop the trains pillagethe luggagevans and scalp the passengersall included calmly retorted fogg adding as he threw down the cardstwo trumpsstuart whose turn it was to deal gathered them up and went onyou are right theoretically mr fogg but practicallypractically also mr stuartid like to see you do it in eighty daysit depends on you  shall we goheaven preserve me  but i would wager four thousand poundsthat such a journey made under these conditions is impossiblequite possible on the contrary returned mr foggwell make it thenthe journey round the world in eighty daysyesi should like nothing betterwhenat once  only i warn you that i shall do it at your expenseits absurd cried stuart who was beginning to be annoyed atthe persistency of his friend  come lets go on with the gamedeal over again then said phileas fogg  theres a false dealstuart took up the pack with a feverish hand then suddenlyput them down againwell mr fogg said he it shall be so i will wagerthe four thousand on itcalm yourself my dear stuart said fallentin  its only a jokewhen i say ill wager returned stuart i mean it  all rightsaid mr fogg and turning to the others he continued  i have a deposit of twenty thousand at barings whichi will willingly risk upon ittwenty thousand pounds cried sullivan  twenty thousand poundswhich you would lose by a single accidental delaythe unforeseen does not exist quietly replied phileas foggbut mr fogg eighty days are only the estimate of the least possibletime in which the journey can be madea wellused minimum suffices for everythingbut in order not to exceed it you must jump mathematicallyfrom the trains upon the steamers and from the steamers uponthe trains againi will jumpmathematicallyyou are jokinga true englishman doesnt joke when he is talking about soserious a thing as a wager replied phileas fogg solemnlyi will bet twenty thousand pounds against anyone who wishesthat i will make the tour of the world in

or else the twenty thousand poundsnow deposited in my name at barings will belong to youin fact and in right gentlemen  here is a cheque for the amounta memorandum of the wager was at once drawn up and signed bythe six parties during which phileas fogg preserved a stoicalcomposure  he certainly did not bet to win and had only stakedthe twenty thousand pounds half of his fortune because heforesaw that he might have to expend the other half to carry outthis difficult not to say unattainable project  as for hisantagonists they seemed much agitated not so much by the valueof their stake as because they had some scruples about bettingunder conditions so difficult to their friendthe clock struck seven and the party offered to suspend thegame so that mr fogg might make his preparations for

wouldgo as far as paris and it would do his eyes good to see paris once morebut surely a gentleman so chary of his steps would stop there no doubtbut then it was none the less true that he was going

took a cab and drove rapidlyto charing cross  the cab stopped before the railway stationat twenty minutes past eight  passepartout jumped off the boxand followed his master who after paying the cabmanwas about to enter the station when a poor beggarwomanwith a child in her arms her naked feet smeared with mudher head covered with a wretched bonnet from which hung a tattered featherand her shoulders shrouded in a ragged shawl approachedand mournfully asked for almsmr fogg took out the twenty guineas he had just won at whistand handed them to the beggar saying here my good womanim glad

the west end  the news of thebet spread through the reform club and afforded an exciting topicof conversation to its members  from the club it soon got intothe papers throughout england  the boasted tour of the worldwas talked about disputed argued with as much warmth as if thesubject were another alabama claim  some took sides with phileasfogg but the large majority shook their heads and declaredagainst him it was absurd impossible they declared that thetour of the world could be made except theoretically and on paperin this minimum of time and with the existing means of travellingthe times standard morning post and daily news and twenty otherhighly respectable newspapers scouted mr foggs project as madnessthe daily telegraph alone hesitatingly supported him  people in generalthought him a lunatic and blamed his reform club friends for havingaccepted a wager which betrayed the mental aberration of its proposerarticles no less passionate than logical appeared on the questionfor geography is one of the pet subjects of the englishand the columns devoted to phileas foggs venture were eagerlydevoured by all classes of readers  at first some rash individualsprincipally of the gentler sex espoused his cause which becamestill more popular when the illustrated london news came outwith his portrait copied from a photograph in the reform cluba few readers of the daily telegraph even dared to saywhy not after all  stranger things have come to passat last a long article appeared on the th of october in the bulletinof the royal geographical society which treated the question fromevery point of view and demonstrated the utter folly of the enterpriseeverything it said was against the travellers every obstacle imposedalike by man and by nature  a miraculous agreement of the times of departureand arrival which was impossible was absolutely necessary to his successhe might perhaps reckon on the arrival of trains at the designated hoursin europe where the distances were relatively moderate but whenhe calculated upon crossing india in three days and the united statesin seven could he rely beyond misgiving upon accomplishing his taskthere were accidents to machinery the liability of trains to run off the linecollisions bad weather the blocking up by snowwere not all these againstphileas fogg  would he not find himself when travelling by steamer in winterat the mercy of the winds and fogs  is it uncommon for the best ocean steamersto be two or three days behind time  but a single delay would suffice tofatally break the

noise and being copied intoall the papers seriously depressed the advocates of the rash touristeverybody knows that england is the world of betting men who areof a higher class than mere gamblers to

yesterday at port saidand the rest of the way is of no account to such a craft  i repeat thatthe mongolia has been in advance of the time required by the companysregulations and gained the prize awarded for excess of speeddoes she come directly from brindisidirectly from brindisi she takes on the indian mails thereand she left there saturday at five pm  have patience mr fixshe will not be late  but really i dont see how from thedescription you have you will be able to recognise your maneven if he is on board the mongoliaa man rather feels the presence of these fellows consulthan recognises them  you must have a scent for themand a scent is like a sixth sense which combines hearingseeing and smelling  ive arrested more than one of these gentlemenin my time and if my thief is on board ill answer for ithell not slip through my fingersi hope so mr fix for it was a heavy robberya magnificent robbery consul fiftyfive thousand poundswe dont often have such windfalls  burglars are getting to be socontemptible nowadays  a fellow gets hung for a handful of shillingsmr fix said the consul i like your way of talking and hopeyoull succeed but i fear you will find it far from easydont you see the description which you have there hasa singular resemblance to an honest manconsul remarked the detective dogmatically great robbersalways resemble honest folks  fellows who have rascally faceshave only one course to take and that is to remain honestotherwise they would be arrested offhand  the artistic thing isto unmask honest countenances its no light task i admitbut a real artmr fix evidently was not wanting in a tinge of selfconceitlittle by little the scene on the quay became more animatedsailors of various nations merchants shipbrokers porters fellahsbustled to and fro as if the steamer were immediately expectedthe weather was clear and slightly chilly  the minarets of the townloomed above the houses in the pale rays of the sun  a jetty piersome two thousand yards along extended into the roadsteada number of fishingsmacks and coasting boats some retainingthe fantastic fashion of ancient galleys were discernible on the red seaas he passed among the busy crowd fix according to habitscrutinised the passersby with a keen rapid glanceit was now halfpast tenthe steamer doesnt come he exclaimed as the port clock struckshe cant be far off now returned his companionhow long will she stop at suezfour hours long enough to get in her coal  it is thirteen hundredand ten miles from suez to aden at the other end of the red seaand she has to take in a fresh coal supplyand does she go from suez directly to bombaywithout putting in anywheregood said fix  if the robber is on board he will no doubtget off at suez so as to reach the dutch or french colonies inasia by some other route  he ought to know that he would not besafe an hour in india which is english soilunless objected the consul he is exceptionally shrewdan english criminal you know is always better concealedn london than anywhere elsethis observation furnished the detective food for thoughtand meanwhile the consul went away to his office  fix left alonewas more impatient than ever having a presentiment that therobber was on board the mongolia  if he had indeed left londonintending to reach the new world he would naturally take theroute via india which was less watched and more difficultto watch than that of the atlantic  but fixs reflections weresoon interrupted by a succession of sharp whistles which announcedthe arrival of the mongolia  the porters and fellahs rusheddown the quay and a dozen boats pushed off from the shore to goand meet the steamer  soon her gigantic hull appeared passingalong between the banks and eleven oclock struck as she anchoredin the road  she brought an unusual number of passengerssome of whom remained on deck to scan the picturesque panoramaof the town while the greater part disembarked in the boatsand landed on the quayfix took up a position and carefully examined each faceand figure which made its appearance  presently one ofthe passengers after vigorously pushing his way through theimportunate crowd of porters came up to him and politely asked ifhe could point out the english consulate at the same time showinga passport which he wished to have visaed  fix instinctively tookthe passport and with a rapid glance read the descriptionof its bearer  an involuntary motion of surprise nearly escaped himfor the description in the passport was identical with that of thebank robber which he had received from scotland yardis this your passport asked heno its my mastersand your master ishe stayed on boardbut he must go to the consuls in person so as to establish his identityoh is that necessaryquite indispensableand where is the consulatethere on the corner of the square said fix pointing toa house two hundred steps offill go and fetch my master who wont be much pleased howeverto be disturbedthe passenger bowed to fix and returned to the steamerchapter viiwhich once more demonstrates the uselessness of passportsas aids to detectivesthe detective passed down the quay and rapidly made his way tothe consuls office where he was at once admitted to the presenceof that officialconsul said he without preamble i have strong reasonsfor believing that my man is a passenger on the mongoliaand he narrated what had just passed concerning the passportwell mr fix replied the consul i shall not be sorry tosee the rascals face but perhaps he wont come herethat isif he is the person you suppose him to be  a robber doesnt quitelike to leave traces of his flight behind him and besideshe is not obliged to have his passport countersignedif he is as shrewd as i think he is consul he will cometo have his passport visaedyes  passports are only good for annoying honest folksand aiding in the flight of rogues  i assure you it will be quitethe thing for him to do but i hope you will not visa the passportwhy not  if the passport is genuine i have no right to refusestill i must keep this man here until i can get a warrant toarrest him from londonah thats your lookout  but i cannotthe consul did not finish his sentence for as he spoke a knock was heardat the door and two strangers entered one of whom was the servantwhom fix had met on the quay  the other who was his masterheld out his passport with the request that the consul would do himthe favour to visa it  the consul took the document and carefully read itwhilst fix observed or rather devoured the stranger with his eyesfrom a corner of the roomyou are mr phileas fogg said the consul after reading the passporti amand this man is your servanthe is a frenchman named passepartoutyou are from londonyesand you are goingto bombayvery good sir  you know that a visa is useless and that no passportis requiredi know it sir replied phileas fogg but i wish to proveby your visa that i came by suezvery well sirthe consul proceeded to sign and date the passport after whichhe added his official seal  mr fogg paid the customary feecoldly bowed and went out followed by his servantwell queried the detectivewell he looks and acts like a perfectly honest man replied the consulpossibly but that is not the question  do you think consulthat this phelgmatic gentleman resembles feature by featurethe robber whose description i have receivedi concede that but then you know all descriptionsill make certain of it interrupted fix  the servant seemsto me less mysterious than the master besides hes a frenchmanand cant help talking  excuse me for a little while consulfix started off in search of passepartoutmeanwhile mr fogg after leaving the consulate repaired tothe quay gave some orders to passepartout went off tothe    mongolia in a boat and descended to

made or the loss suffered on arrival at each localitythis methodical record thus contained an account of everything neededand mr fogg always knew whether he was behindhand or in advanceof his time  on this friday october th he noted his arrival at suezand observed that he had as yet neither gained nor losthe sat down quietly to breakfast in his cabin never once thinkingof inspecting the town being one of those englishmen who are wontto see foreign countries through the eyes of their domesticschapter viiiin which passepartout talks rather more perhaps than is prudentfix soon rejoined passepartout who was lounging and looking abouton the quay as if he did not feel that he at least was obligednot to see anythingwell my friend said the detective coming up with himis your passport visaedah its you is it monsieur responded passepartoutthanks yes the passport is all rightand you are looking about youyes but we travel so fast that i seem to be journeying in a dreamso this is suezyesin egyptcertainly in egyptand in africain africain africa repeated passepartout  just think monsieuri had no idea that we should go farther than paris and all that isaw of paris was between twenty minutes past seven and twentyminutes before nine in the morning between the northern andthe lyons stations through the windows of a car and in adriving rain  how i regret not having seen once more pere la chaiseand the circus in the champs elyseesyou are in a great hurry theni am not but my master is  by the way i must buy some shoes and shirtswe came away without trunks only with a carpetbagi will show you an excellent shop for getting what you wantreally monsieur you are very kindand they walked off together passepartout chatting volublyas they went alongabove all said he dont let me lose the steameryou have plenty of time its only twelve oclockpassepartout pulled out his big watch  twelve he exclaimedwhy its only eight minutes before tenyour watch is slowmy watch  a family watch monsieur which has come down frommy greatgrandfather  it doesnt vary five minutes in the yearits a perfect chronometer look youi see how it is said fix  you have kept london timewhich is two hours behind that of suez  you ought to regulateyour watch at noon in each countryi regulate my watch  neverwell then it will not agree with the sunso much the worse for the sun monsieur  the sun will be wrong thenand the worthy fellow returned the watch to its fob with adefiant gesture  after a few minutes silence fix resumedyou left london hastily theni rather think so  last friday at eight oclock in the eveningmonsieur fogg came home from his club and threequarters of an hourafterwards we were offbut where is your master goingalways straight ahead  he is going round the worldround the world cried fixyes and in eighty days  he says it is on a wager but between usi dont believe a word of it  that wouldnt be common sensetheres something else in the windah  mr fogg is a character is hei should say he wasis he richno doubt for he is carrying an enormous sum in brand newbanknotes with him  and he doesnt spare the money on the wayeither he has offered a large reward to the engineer of themongolia if he gets us to bombay well in advance of timeand you have known your master a long timewhy no i entered his service the very day we left londonthe effect of these replies upon the already suspiciousand excited detective may be imagined  the hasty departurefrom london soon after the robbery the large sum carried by mr fogghis eagerness to reach distant countries the pretext of aneccentric and foolhardy betall confirmed fix in his theoryhe continued to pump poor passepartout and learned that he reallyknew little or nothing of his master who lived a solitaryexistence in london was said to be rich though no one knewwhence came his riches and was mysterious and impenetrablein his affairs and habits  fix felt sure that phileas foggwould not land at suez but was really going on to bombayis bombay far from here asked passepartoutpretty far  it is a ten days voyage by seaand in what country is bombayindiain asiacertainlythe deuce  i was going to tell you theres one thing that worries memy burnerwhat burnermy gasburner which i forgot to turn off and which is atthis moment burning at my expense  i have calculated monsieurthat i lose two shillings every four and twenty hours exactlysixpense more than i earn and you will understand that the longerour journeydid fix pay any attention to passepartouts trouble about the gasit is not probable  he was not listening but was cogitating a projectpassepartout and he had now reached the shop where fix left his companionto make his purchases after recommending him not to miss the steamerand hurried back to the consulate  now that he was fully convincedfix had quite recovered his equanimityconsul said he i have no longer any doubt  i have spotted my manhe passes himself off as an odd stick who is going round the worldin eighty daysthen hes a sharp fellow returned the consul and counts onreturning to london after putting the police of the two countriesoff his trackwell see about that replied fixbut are you not mistakeni am not mistakenwhy was this robber so anxious to prove by the visathat he had passed through suezwhy  i have no idea but listen to mehe reported in a few words the most important partsof his conversation with passepartoutin short said the consul appearances are wholly against this manand what are you going to dosend a dispatch to london for a warrant of arrest to be dispatchedinstantly to bombay take passage on board the mongolia follow my rogueto india and there on english ground arrest him politely with my warrantin my hand and my hand on his shoulderhaving uttered these words with a cool careless air the detectivetook leave of the consul and repaired to the telegraph officewhence he sent the dispatch which we have seen to the london police officea quarter of an hour later found fix with a small bag in his handproceeding on board the mongolia and ere many moments longerthe noble steamer rode out at full steam upon the waters of the red seachapter ixin which the red sea and the indian ocean prove propitiousto the designs of phileas foggthe distance between suez and aden is precisely thirteen hundredand ten miles and the regulations of the company allow thesteamers one hundred and thirtyeight hours in which to traverse itthe mongolia thanks to the vigorous exertions of the engineerseemed likely so rapid was her speed to reach her destinationconsiderably within that time  the greater part of the passengersfrom brindisi were bound for india some for bombay others for calcuttaby way of bombay the nearest route thither now that a railway crossesthe indian peninsula  among the passengers was a number of officialsand military officers of various grades the latter being either attachedto the regular british forces or commanding the sepoy troopsand receiving high salaries ever since the centralgovernment has assumed the powers of the east india companyfor the sublieutenants get  pounds brigadiers  poundsand generals of divisions  pounds  what with the military mena number of rich young englishmen on their travels and the hospitableefforts of the purser the time passed quickly on the mongoliathe best of fare was spread upon the cabin tables at breakfastlunch dinner and the eight oclock supper and the ladiesscrupulously changed their toilets twice a day and the hourswere whirled away when the sea was tranquil with music dancing and gamesbut the red sea is full of caprice and often boisterous like most longand narrow gulfs  when the wind came from the african or asian coastthe mongolia with her long hull rolled fearfully  then the ladiesspeedily disappeared below the pianos were silent singing and dancingsuddenly ceased  yet the good ship ploughed straight on unretarded by windor wave towards the straits of babelmandeb  what was phileas foggdoing all this time  it might be thought that in his anxiety he wouldbe constantly watching the changes of the wind the disorderly ragingof the billowsevery chance in short which might force the mongoliato slacken her speed and thus interrupt his journey  but if he thoughtof these possibilities he did not betray the fact by any outward signalways the same impassible member of the reform club whom noincident could surprise as unvarying as the ships chronometersand seldom having the curiosity even to go upon the deck he passedthrough the memorable scenes of the red sea with cold indifferencedid not care to recognise the historic towns and villages whichalong its borders raised their picturesque outlines against the skyand betrayed no fear of the dangers of the arabic gulf which the oldhistorians always spoke of with horror and upon which the ancientnavigators never ventured without propitiating the gods by ample sacrificeshow did this eccentric personage pass his time on the mongolia  he made hisfour hearty meals every day regardless of the most persistent rollingand pitching on the part of the steamer and he played whist indefatigablyfor he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himselfa taxcollector on the way to his post at goa the rev decimus smithreturning to his parish at bombay and a brigadiergeneral of the english armywho was about to rejoin his brigade at benares made up the party andwith mr fogg played whist by the hour together in absorbing silenceas for passepartout he too had escaped seasickness and took his mealsconscientiously in the forward cabin  he rather enjoyed the voyagefor he was well fed and well lodged took a great interest in the scenesthrough which they were passing and consoled himself with the delusionthat his masters whim would end at bombay  he was pleased on the day afterleaving suez to find on deck the obliging person with whom he had walkedand chatted on the quaysif i am not mistaken said he approaching this person with his mostamiable smile you are the gentleman who so kindly volunteeredto guide me at suezah  i quite recognise you  you are the servant of the strange englishmanjust so monsieurfixmonsieur fix resumed passepartout im charmed to find you on boardwhere are you boundlike you to bombaythats capital  have you made this trip

fakirs pagodas tigerssnakes elephants  i hope you will have ample time to see the sightsi hope so monsieur fix  you see a man of sound sense ought notto spend his life jumping from a steamer upon a railway trainand from a railway train upon a steamer again pretending to make the tourof the world in eighty days  no all these gymnastics you may be surewill cease at bombayand mr fogg is getting on well asked fix in the most naturaltone in the worldquite well and i too  i eat like a famished ogre its the sea airbut i never see your master on decknever he hasnt the least curiositydo you know mr passepartout that this pretended tour in eighty daysmay conceal some secret errandperhaps a diplomatic missionfaith monsieur fix i assure you i know nothing about itnor would i give half a crown to find outafter this meeting passepartout and fix got into the habitof chatting together the latter making it a point to gainthe worthy mans confidence  he frequently offered him a glassof whiskey or pale ale in the steamer barroom which passepartoutnever failed to accept with graceful alacrity mentally pronouncingfix the best of good fellowsmeanwhile the mongolia was pushing forward rapidly on

do urged it upon him to be at the stationpromptly at eight and with his regular step which beat to the secondlike a astronomical clock directed his steps to the passport officeas for the wonders of bombay its famous city hall its splendid libraryits forts and docks its bazaars mosques synagogues its armenian churchesand the noble pagoda on malabar hill with its two polygonal towershe cared not a straw to see them  he would not deign to examineeven the masterpieces of elephanta or the mysterious hypogeaconcealed southeast from the docks or those fine remains of buddhistarchitecture the kanherian grottoes of the island of salcettehaving transacted his business at the passport office phileas foggrepaired quietly to the railway station where he ordered dinneramong the dishes served up to him the landlord especially recommendeda certain giblet of native rabbit on which he prided himselfmr fogg accordingly tasted the dish but despite its spiced saucefound it far from palatable  he rang for the landlord andon his appearance said fixing his clear eyes upon himis this rabbit siryes my lord the rogue boldly replied rabbit from the junglesand this rabbit did not mew when he was killedmew my lord  what a rabbit mew  i swear to yoube so good landlord as not to swear but remember thiscats were formerly considered in india as sacred animalsthat was a good timefor the cats my lordperhaps for the travellers as wellafter which mr fogg quietly continued his dinner  fix had goneon shore shortly after mr fogg and his first destination wasthe headquarters of the bombay police  he made himself knownas a london detective told his business at bombay and theposition of affairs relative to the supposed robber and nervouslyasked if a warrant had arrived from london  it had not reachedthe office indeed there had not yet been time for it to arrivefix was sorely disappointed and tried to obtain an order of arrestfrom the director of the bombay police  this the director refusedas the matter concerned the london office which alone could legallydeliver the warrant  fix did not insist and was fain to resign himselfto await the arrival of the important document but he was determinednot to lose sight of the mysterious rogue as long as he stayed in bombayhe did not doubt for a moment any more than passepartout that phileas foggwould remain there at least until it was time for the warrant to arrivepassepartout however had no sooner heard his masters orderson leaving the mongolia than he saw at once that they were toleave bombay as they had done suez and paris and that the journeywould be extended at least as far as calcutta and perhaps beyondthat place  he began to ask himself if this bet that mr foggtalked about was not really in good earnest and whether his fatewas not in truth forcing him despite his love of repose aroundthe world in eighty dayshaving purchased the usual quota of shirts and shoes he tooka leisurely promenade about the streets where crowds of peopleof many nationalitieseuropeans persians with pointed capsbanyas with round turbans sindes with square bonnets parseeswith black mitres and longrobed armenianswere collectedit happened to be the day of a parsee festival  these descendantsof the sect of zoroasterthe most thrifty civilised intelligentand austere of the east indians among whom are counted the richestnative merchants of bombaywere celebrating a sort of religious carnivalwith processions and shows in the midst of which indian dancinggirlsclothed in rosecoloured gauze looped up with gold and silverdanced airily but with perfect modesty to the sound of violsand the clanging of tambourines  it is needless to say that passepartoutwatched these curious ceremonies with staring eyes and gaping mouthand that his countenance was that of the greenest booby imaginableunhappily for his master as well as himself his curiositydrew him unconsciously farther off than he intended to goat last having seen the parsee carnival wind away in the distancehe was turning his steps towards the station when he happenedto espy the splendid pagoda on malabar hill and was seized withan irresistible desire to see its interior  he was quite ignorantthat it is forbidden to christians to enter certain indian templesand that even the faithful must not go in without first leaving theirshoes outside the door  it may be said here that the wise policyof the british government severely punishes a disregard of the practicesof the native religionspassepartout however thinking no harm went in like a simple touristand was soon lost in admiration of the splendid brahmin ornamentationwhich everywhere met his eyes when of a sudden he found himself sprawlingon the sacred flagging  he looked up to behold three enraged priestswho forthwith fell upon him tore off his shoes and began to beat himwith loud savage exclamations  the agile frenchman was soon upon his feetagain and lost no time in knocking down two of his longgownedadversaries with his fists and a vigorous application of his toesthen rushing out of the pagoda as fast as his legs could carry himhe soon escaped the third priest by mingling with the crowd in the streetsat five minutes before eight passepartout hatless shoelessand having in the squabble lost his package of shirts and shoesrushed breathlessly into the stationfix who had followed mr fogg to the station and saw that hewas really going to leave bombay was there upon the platformhe had resolved to follow the supposed robber to calcuttaand farther if necessary  passepartout did not observe thedetective who stood in an obscure corner but fix heard himrelate his adventures in a few words to mr foggi hope that this will not happen again said phileas fogg coldlyas he got into the train  poor passepartout quite crestfallenfollowed his master without a word  fix was on the point of enteringanother carriage when an idea struck him which induced him to alter his planno ill stay muttered he  an offence has been committed on indian soilive got my manjust then the locomotive gave a sharp screech and the train passed outinto the darkness of the nightchapter xiin which phileas fogg secures a curious means of conveyanceat a fabulous pricethe train had started punctually  among the passengers werea number of officers government officials and opium and indigomerchants whose business called them to the eastern coastpassepartout rode in the same carriage with his master and athird passenger occupied a seat opposite to them  this wassir francis cromarty one of mr foggs whist partnerson the mongolia now on his way to join his corps at benaressir francis was a tall fair man of fifty who had greatlydistinguished himself in the last sepoy revolt  he made indiahis home only paying brief visits to england at rare intervalsand was almost as familiar as a native with the customs historyand character of india and its people  but phileas fogg who wasnot travelling but only describing a circumference took no painsto inquire into these subjects he was a solid body traversingan orbit around the terrestrial globe according to the lawsof rational mechanics  he was at this moment calculating in his mindthe number of hours spent since his departure from london andhad it been in his nature to make a useless demonstrationwould have rubbed his hands for satisfaction  sir francis cromartyhad observed the oddity of his travelling companionalthough theonly opportunity he had for studying him had been while he wasdealing the cards and between two rubbersand questioned himselfwhether a human heart really beat beneath this cold exteriorand whether phileas fogg had any sense of the beauties of naturethe brigadiergeneral was free to mentally confess thatof all the eccentric persons he had ever met none was comparableto this product of the exact sciencesphileas fogg had not concealed from sir francis his design of goinground the world nor the circumstances under which he set outand the general only saw in the wager a useless eccentricityand a lack of sound common sense  in the way this strange gentlemanwas going on he would leave the world without having done any goodto himself or anybody elsean hour after leaving bombay the train had passed the viaductsand the island of salcette and had got into the open countryat callyan they reached the junction of the branch line whichdescends towards southeastern india by kandallah and pounahand passing pauwell they entered the defiles of the mountainswith their basalt bases and their summits crowned with thickand verdant forests  phileas fogg and sir francis cromarty exchangeda few words from time to time and now sir francis reviving the conversationobserved some years ago mr fogg you would have met with a delayat this point which would probably have lost you your wagerhow so sir francisbecause the railway stopped at the base of these mountainswhich the passengers were obliged to cross in palanquinsor on ponies to kandallah on the other sidesuch a delay would not have deranged my plans in the leastsaid mr fogg  i have constantly foreseen the likelihood ofcertain obstaclesbut mr fogg pursued sir francis you run the risk ofhaving some difficulty about this worthy fellows adventureat the pagoda  passepartout his feet comfortably wrappedin his travellingblanket was sound asleep and did not dreamthat anybody was talking about him  the government is very severeupon that kind of offence  it takes particular care that thereligious customs of the indians should be respectedand if your servant were caughtvery well sir francis replied mr fogg if he had beencaught he would have been condemned and punished and then wouldhave quietly returned to europe  i dont see how this affaircould have delayed his masterthe conversation fell again  during the night the train leftthe mountains behind and passed nassik and the next dayproceeded over the flat wellcultivated country of the

halfpast twelve the train stopped at burhampoor wherepassepartout was able to purchase some indian slippersornamented with false pearls in which with evident vanityhe proceeded to encase his feet  the travellers made a hasty breakfastand started off for assurghur after skirting for a little the banksof the small river tapty which empties into the gulf of cambray near suratpassepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie  up tohis arrival at bombay he had entertained hopes that their journeywould end there but now that they were plainly whirling acrossindia at full speed a sudden change had come over the spirit ofhis dreams  his old vagabond nature returned to him the fantasticideas of his youth once more took possession of him  he came to regardhis masters project as intended in good earnest believed in the realityof the bet and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessityof making it without fail within the designated period  already he beganto worry about possible delays and accidents which might happen on the wayhe recognised himself as being personally interested in the wagerand trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing itby his unpardonable folly of the night before  being much less coolheadedthan mr fogg he was much more restless counting and recounting thedays passed over uttering maledictions when the train stoppedand accusing it of sluggishness and mentally blaming mr foggfor not having bribed the engineer  the worthy fellow was ignorant thatwhile it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamerit could not be done on the railwaythe train entered the defiles of the sutpour mountains which separatethe khandeish from bundelcund towards evening  the next day sir franciscromarty asked passepartout what time it was to which on consultinghis watch he replied that it was three in the morning  this famous timepiecealways regulated on the greenwich meridian which was now some seventysevendegrees westward was at least four hours slow  sir francis correctedpassepartouts time whereupon the latter made the same remark that he haddone to fix and up on the general insisting that the watch should beregulated in each new meridian since he was constantly going eastwardthat is in the face of the sun and therefore the days were shorterby four minutes for each degree gone over passepartout obstinately refusedto alter his watch which he kept at london time  it was an innocent delusionwhich could harm no onethe train stopped at eight oclock in the midst of a glade somefifteen miles beyond rothal where there were several bungalowsand workmens cabins  the conductor passing along the carriagesshouted passengers will get out herephileas fogg looked at sir francis cromarty for an explanationbut the general could not tell what meant a halt in the midstof this forest of dates and acaciaspassepartout not less surprised rushed out and speedily returned cryingmonsieur no more railwaywhat do you mean asked sir francisi mean to say that the train isnt going onthe general at once stepped out while phileas fogg calmly followed himand they proceeded together to the conductorwhere are we asked sir francisat the hamlet of kholbydo we stop herecertainly  the railway isnt finishedwhat not finishedno  theres still a matter of fifty miles to be laidfrom here to allahabad where the line begins againbut the papers announced the opening of the railway throughoutwhat would you have officer  the papers were mistakenyet you sell tickets from bombay to calcutta retorted sir franciswho was growing warmno doubt replied the conductor but the passengers knowthat they must provide means of transportation for themselvesfrom kholby to allahabadsir francis was furious  passepartout would willingly have knockedthe conductor down and did not dare to look at his mastersir francis said mr fogg quietly we will if you pleaselook about for some means of conveyance to allahabadmr fogg this is a delay greatly to your disadvantageno sir francis it was foreseenwhat  you knew that the waynot at all but i knew that some obstacle or other would sooner or laterarise on my route  nothing therefore is lost i have two dayswhich i have already gained to sacrifice  a steamer leaves calcuttafor hong kong at noon on the th  this is the nd and we shallreach calcutta in timethere was nothing to say to so confident a responseit was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this pointthe papers were like some watches which have a way of getting too fastand had been premature in their announcement of the completion of the linethe greater part of the travellers were aware of this interruption andleaving the train they began to engage such vehicles as the villagecould provide fourwheeled palkigharis waggons drawn by zebuscarriages that looked like perambulating pagodas palanquins poniesand what notmr fogg and sir francis cromarty after searching the villagefrom end to end came back without having found anythingi shall go afoot said phileas foggpassepartout who had now rejoined his master made a wry grimaceas he thought of his magnificent but too frail indian shoeshappily he too had been looking about him and after a moments hesitationsaid monsieur i think i have found a means of conveyancewhatan elephant  an elephant that belongs to an indian who livesbut a hundred steps from herelets go and see the elephant replied mr foggthey soon reached a small hut near which enclosed withinsome high palings was the animal in question  an indian cameout of the hut and at their request conducted them withinthe enclosure  the elephant which its owner had reared not fora beast of burden but for warlike purposes was half domesticatedthe indian had begun already by often irritating him and feedinghim every three months on sugar and butter to impart to hima ferocity not in his nature this method being often employedby those who train the indian elephants for battle  happilyhowever for mr fogg the animals instruction in this directionhad not gone far and the elephant still preserved his naturalgentleness  kiounithis was the name of the beastcoulddoubtless travel rapidly for a long time and in default ofany other means of conveyance mr fogg resolved to hire himbut elephants are far from cheap in india where they are becomingscarce the males which alone are suitable for circus showsare much sought especially as but few of them are domesticatedwhen therefore mr fogg proposed to the indian to hire kiounihe refused pointblank  mr fogg persisted offering the excessivesum of ten pounds an hour for the loan of the beast to allahabadrefused  twenty pounds  refused also  forty pounds  still refusedpassepartout jumped at each advance but the indian declined to be temptedyet the offer was an alluring one for supposing it took the elephantfifteen hours to reach allahabad his owner would receive no less thansix hundred pounds sterlingphileas fogg without getting in the least flurried then proposedto purchase the animal outright and at first offered a thousand poundsfor him  the indian perhaps thinking he was going to make a great bargainstill refusedsir francis cromarty took mr fogg aside and begged him to reflectbefore he went any further to which that gentleman replied thathe was not in the habit of acting rashly that a bet of twenty thousandpounds was at stake that the elephant was absolutely necessary to himand that he would secure him if he had to pay twenty times his valuereturning to the indian whose small sharp eyes glistening with avaricebetrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a pricehe could obtain  mr fogg offered first twelve hundred then fifteen hundredeighteen hundred two thousand pounds  passepartout usually so rubicundwas fairly white with suspenseat two thousand pounds the indian yieldedwhat a price good heavens cried passepartout for an elephantit only remained now to find a guide which was comparatively easya young parsee with an intelligent face offered his serviceswhich mr fogg accepted promising so generous a reward as to materiallystimulate his zeal  the elephant was led out and equipped  the parseewho was an accomplished elephant driver covered his back with a sortof saddlecloth and attached to each of his flanks some curiouslyuncomfortable howdahs  phileas fogg paid the indian with some banknoteswhich he extracted from the famous carpetbag a proceeding that seemedto deprive poor passepartout of his vitals  then he offered to carrysir francis to allahabad which the brigadier gratefully acceptedas one traveller the more would not be likely to fatigue thegigantic beast  provisions were purchased at kholby andwhile sir francis and mr fogg took the howdahs on either sidepassepartout got astride the saddlecloth between themthe parsee perched himself on the elephants neck and at nine oclockthey set out from the village the animal marching off through thedense forest of palms by the shortest cutchapter xiiin which phileas fogg and his companionsventure across the indian forests and what ensuedin order to shorten the journey the guide passed to the left of the linewhere the railway was still in process of being built  this lineowing to the capricious turnings of the vindhia mountainsdid not pursue a straight course  the parsee who was quite familiarwith the roads and paths in the district declared that they would gaintwenty miles by striking directly through the forestphileas fogg and sir francis cromarty plunged to the neckin the peculiar howdahs provided for them were horribly jostledby the swift trotting of the elephant spurred on as he was bythe skilful parsee but they endured the discomfort with truebritish phlegm talking little and scarcely able to catch a glimpseof each other  as for passepartout who was mounted on the beasts backand received the direct force of each concussion as he trod alonghe was very careful in accordance with his masters adviceto keep his tongue from between his teeth as it would otherwisehave been bitten off short  the worthy fellow bounced fromthe elephants neck to his rump and vaulted like a clown on a springboardyet he laughed in the midst of his bouncing and from time to time tooka piece of sugar out of his pocket and inserted it in kiounis trunkwho received it without in the least slackening his regular trotafter two hours the guide stopped the elephant and gave himan hour for rest during which kiouni after quenching his thirstat a neighbouring spring set to devouring the branches and shrubsround about him  neither sir francis nor mr fogg regrettedthe delay and both descended with a feeling of relief  why hesmade of iron exclaimed the general gazing admiringly on kiouniof forged iron replied passepartout as he set about preparinga hasty breakfastat noon the parsee gave the signal of departure  the countrysoon presented a very savage aspect  copses of dates anddwarfpalms succeeded the dense forests then vast dry plainsdotted with scanty shrubs and sown with great blocks of syeniteall this portion of bundelcund which is little frequentedby travellers is inhabited by a fanatical populationhardened in the most horrible practices of the hindoo faiththe english have not been able to secure complete dominion overthis territory which is subjected to the influence of rajahswhom it is almost impossible to reach in their inaccessiblemountain fastnesses the travellers several times saw bandsof ferocious indians who when they perceived the elephantstriding acrosscountry made angry arid threatening motionsthe parsee avoided them as much as possible  few animals wereobserved on the route even the monkeys hurried from their pathwith contortions and grimaces which convulsed passepartout with laughterin the midst of his gaiety however one thought troubled the worthy servantwhat would mr fogg do with the elephant when he got to allahabadwould he carry him on with him  impossible  the cost of transporting himwould make him ruinously expensive  would he sell him or set him freethe estimable beast certainly deserved some consideration  should mr foggchoose to make him passepartout a present of kiouni he would be very muchembarrassed and these thoughts did not cease worrying him for a long timethe principal chain of the vindhias was crossed by eight in the eveningand another halt was made on the northern slope in a ruined bungalowthey had gone nearly twentyfive miles that day and an equal distancestill separated them from the station of allahabadthe night was cold  the parsee lit a fire in the bungalowwith a few dry branches and the warmth was very gratefulprovisions purchased at kholby sufficed for supper and thetravellers ate ravenously  the conversation beginning with a fewdisconnected phrases soon gave place to loud and steady snoresthe guide watched kiouni who slept standing bolstering himselfagainst the trunk of a large tree  nothing occurred during thenight to disturb the slumberers although occasional growls frontpanthers and chatterings of monkeys broke the silence the moreformidable beasts made no cries or hostile demonstration againstthe occupants of the bungalow  sir francis slept heavily like anhonest soldier overcome with fatigue  passepartout was wrapped inuneasy dreams of the bouncing of the day before  as for mr fogghe slumbered as peacefully as if he had been in his serene mansionin saville rowthe journey was resumed at six in the morning the guide hopedto reach allahabad by evening  in that case mr fogg would onlylose a part of the fortyeight hours saved since the beginningof the tour  kiouni resuming his rapid gait soon descendedthe lower spurs of the vindhias and towards noon they passedby the village of kallenger on the cani one of the branchesof the ganges  the guide avoided inhabited places thinking it saferto keep the open country which lies along the first depressionsof the basin of the great river  allahabad was now only twelve milesto the northeast  they stopped under a clump of bananasthe fruit of which as healthy as bread and as succulent as creamwas amply partaken of and appreciatedat two oclock the guide entered a thick forest which extendedseveral miles he preferred to travel under cover of the woodsthey had not as yet had any unpleasant encounters and the journeyseemed on the point of being successfully accomplished when theelephant becoming restless suddenly stoppedit was then four oclockwhats the matter asked sir francis putting out his headi dont know officer replied the parsee listening attentivelyto a confused murmur which came through the thick branchesthe murmur soon became more distinct it now seemed like a distantconcert of human voices accompanied by brass instrumentspassepartout was all eyes and ears  mr fogg patientlywaited without a word  the parsee jumped to the groundfastened the elephant to a tree and plunged into the thickethe soon returned sayinga procession of brahmins is coming this way  we must preventtheir seeing us if possiblethe guide unloosed the elephant and led him into a thicketat the same time asking the travellers not to stir  he held himselfready to bestride the animal at a moments notice should flightbecome necessary but he evidently thought that the processionof the faithful would pass without perceiving them amidthe thick foliage in which they were wholly concealedthe discordant tones of the voices and instruments drew nearerand now droning songs mingled with the sound of the tambourines and cymbalsthe head of the procession soon appeared beneath the treesa hundred paces away and the strange figures who performed the religiousceremony were easily distinguished through the branchesfirst came the priests with mitres on their headsand clothed in long lace robes  they were surrounded by menwomen and children who sang a kind of lugubrious psalminterrupted at regular intervals by the tambourines and cymbalswhile behind them was drawn a car with large wheelsthe spokes of which represented serpents entwined with each otherupon the car which was drawn by four richly caparisoned zebusstood a hideous statue with four arms the body coloured a dull redwith haggard eyes dishevelled hair protruding tongue and lips tintedwith betel  it stood upright upon the figure of a prostrateand headless giantsir francis recognising the statue whispered the goddess kalithe goddess of love and deathof death perhaps muttered back passepartout but of lovethat ugly old hag  neverthe parsee made a motion to keep silencea group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round the statuethese were striped with ochre and covered with cuts whence their bloodissued drop by dropstupid fanatics who in the great indian ceremoniesstill throw themselves under the wheels of juggernaut  some brahminsclad in all the sumptuousness of oriental apparel and leading a womanwho faltered at every step followed  this woman was young and asfair as a european  her head and neck shoulders ears armshands and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems with braceletsearrings and rings while a tunic bordered with gold and coveredwith a light muslin robe betrayed the outline of her formthe guards who followed the young woman presented a violent contrastto her armed as they were with naked sabres hung at their waistsand long damascened pistols and bearing a corpse on a palanquinit was the body of an old man gorgeously arrayed in the habilimentsof a rajah wearing as in life a turban embroidered with pearlsa robe of tissue of silk and gold a scarf of cashmere sewed with diamondsand the magnificent weapons of a hindoo prince  next came the musiciansand a rearguard of capering fakirs whose cries sometimes drowned the noiseof the instruments these closed the processionsir francis watched the procession with a sad countenance andturning to the guide said a sutteethe parsee nodded and put his finger to his lips  the procession slowlywound under the trees and soon its last ranks disappeared in the depthsof the wood  the songs gradually died away occasionally cries were heardin the distance until at last all was silence againphileas fogg had heard what sir francis said and as soon asthe procession had disappeared asked what is a sutteea suttee returned the general is a human sacrifice but a voluntary onethe woman you have just seen will be burned tomorrow at the dawn of dayoh the scoundrels cried passepartout who could not represshis indignationand the corpse asked mr foggis that of the prince her husband said the guide an independentrajah of bundelcundis it possible resumed phileas fogg his voice betraying notthe least emotion that these barbarous customs still exist in indiaand that the english have been unable to put a stop to themthese sacrifices do not occur in the larger portion of indiareplied sir francis but we have no power over these savage territoriesand especially here in bundelcund  the whole district north of the vindhiasis the theatre of incessant murders and pillagethe poor wretch exclaimed passepartout to be burned aliveyes returned sir francis burned alive  and if she were notyou cannot conceive what treatment she would be obliged to submitto from her relatives  they would shave off her hair feed heron a scanty allowance of rice treat her with contemptshe would be looked upon as an unclean creature and would diein some corner like a scurvy dog  the prospect of so frightfulan existence drives these poor creatures to the sacrificemuch more than love or religious fanaticism  sometimes howeverthe sacrifice is really voluntary and it requires the activeinterference of the government to prevent it  several years agowhen i was living at bombay a young widow asked permissionof the governor to be burned along with her husbands bodybut as you may imagine he refused  the woman left the towntook refuge with an independent rajah and there carried outher selfdevoted purposewhile sir francis was speaking the guide shook his head several timesand now said the sacrifice which will take place tomorrow at dawnis not a voluntary onehow do you knoweverybody knows about this affair in bundelcundbut the wretched creature did not seem to be making any resistanceobserved sir francisthat was because they had intoxicated her with fumes of hemp and opiumbut where are they taking herto the pagoda of pillaji two miles from here she will pass the night thereand the sacrifice will take placetomorrow at the first light of dawnthe guide now led the elephant out of the thicket and leaped upon his neckjust at the moment that he was about to urge kiouni forward with a peculiarwhistle mr fogg stopped him and turning to sir francis cromarty saidsuppose we save this womansave the woman mr foggi have yet twelve hours to spare i can devote them to thatwhy you are a man of heartsometimes replied phileas fogg quietly when i have the timechapter xiiiin which passepartout receives a new proofthat fortune favors the bravethe project was a bold one full of difficulty perhaps impracticablemr fogg was going to risk life or at least liberty and thereforethe success of his tour  but he did not hesitate and he found insir francis cromarty an enthusiastic allyas for passepartout he was ready for anything that might be proposedhis masters idea charmed him he perceived a heart a soul under thaticy exterior  he began to love phileas foggthere remained the guide what course would he adopt  would henot take part with the indians  in default of his assistanceit was necessary to be assured of his neutralitysir francis frankly put the question to himofficers replied the guide i am a parsee and this woman is a parseecommand me as you willexcellent said mr fogghowever resumed the guide it is certain not only thatwe shall risk our lives but horrible tortures if we are takenthat is foreseen replied mr fogg  i think we must wait till nightbefore actingi think so said the guidethe worthy indian then gave some account of the victim whohe said was a celebrated beauty of the parsee race and thedaughter of a wealthy bombay merchant  she had received athoroughly english education in that city and from her mannersand intelligence would be thought an european  her name was aoudaleft an orphan she was married against her will to the old rajahof bundelcund and knowing the fate that awaited her she escapedwas retaken and devoted by the rajahs relatives who had an interestin her death to the sacrifice from which it seemed she could not escapethe parsees narrative only confirmed mr fogg and his companionsin their generous design  it was decided that the guide should directthe elephant towards the pagoda of pillaji which he accordingly approachedas quickly as possible  they halted half an hour afterwards in a copsesome five hundred feet from the pagoda where they were well concealedbut they could hear the groans and cries of the fakirs distinctlythey then discussed the means of getting at the victim  the guidewas familiar with the pagoda of pillaji in which as he declaredthe young woman was imprisoned  could they enter any of its doorswhile the whole party of indians was plunged in a drunken sleepor was it safer to attempt to make a hole in the wallsthis could only be determined at the moment and the place themselvesbut it was certain that the abduction must be made that nightand not when at break of day the victim was led to her funeral pyrethen no human intervention could save heras soon as night fell about six oclock they decided to makea reconnaissance around the pagoda  the cries of the fakirs werejust ceasing the indians were in the act of plunging themselvesinto the drunkenness caused by liquid opium mingled with hempand it might be possible to slip between them to the temple itselfthe parsee leading the others noiselessly crept through the woodand in ten minutes they found themselves on the banks of a small streamwhence by the light of the rosin torches they perceived a pyre of woodon the top of which lay the embalmed body of the rajah which was to beburned with his wife  the pagoda whose minarets loomed above the treesin the deepening dusk stood a hundred steps awaycome whispered the guidehe slipped more cautiously than ever through the brushfollowed by his companions the silence around was only brokenby the low murmuring of the wind among the branchessoon the parsee stopped on the borders of the glade which was lit upby the torches  the ground was covered by groups of the indiansmotionless in their drunken sleep it seemed a battlefield strewnwith the dead  men women and children lay togetherin the background among the trees the pagoda of pillajiloomed distinctly  much to the guides disappointmentthe guards of the rajah lighted by torches were watchingat the doors and marching to and fro with naked sabresprobably the priests too were watching withinthe parsee now convinced that it was impossible to forcean entrance to the temple advanced no farther but led hiscompanions back again  phileas fogg and sir francis cromartyalso saw that nothing could be attempted in that directionthey stopped and engaged in a whispered colloquyit is only eight now said the brigadier and these guardsmay also go to sleepit is not impossible returned the parseethey lay down at the foot of a tree and waitedthe time seemed long the guide ever and anon left themto take an observation on the edge of the wood but the guardswatched steadily by the glare of the torches and a dim lightcrept through the windows of the pagodathey waited till midnight but no change took place among the guardsand it became apparent that their yielding to sleep could not be counted onthe other plan must be carried out an opening in the walls of the pagodamust be made  it remained to ascertain whether the priests were watchingby the side of their victim as assiduously as were the soldiers at the doorafter a last consultation the guide announced that he was readyfor the attempt and advanced followed by the others  they tooka roundabout way so as to get at the pagoda on the rearthey reached the walls about halfpast twelve without having met anyonehere there was no guard nor were there either windows or doorsthe night was dark  the moon on the wane scarcely left the horizonand was covered with heavy clouds the height of the trees deepenedthe darknessit was not enough to reach the walls an opening in them mustbe accomplished and to attain this purpose the party only hadtheir pocketknives  happily the temple walls were built of brickand wood which could be penetrated with little difficultyafter one brick had been taken out the rest would yield easilythey set noiselessly to work and the parsee on one sideand passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricksso as to make an aperture two feet wide  they were getting on rapidlywhen suddenly a cry was heard in the interior of the templefollowed almost instantly by other cries replying from the outsidepassepartout and the guide stopped  had they been heard  was thealarm being given  common prudence urged them to retire and theydid so followed by phileas fogg and sir francis  they again hidthemselves in the wood and waited till the disturbance whateverit might be ceased holding themselves ready to resume their attemptwithout delay  but awkwardly enough the guards now appearedat the rear of the temple and there installed themselvesin readiness to prevent a surpriseit would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the partythus interrupted in their work  they could not now reach the victimhow then could they save her  sir francis shook his fistspassepartout was beside himself and the guide gnashed his teeth with ragethe tranquil fogg waited without betraying any emotionwe have nothing to do but to go away whispered sir francisnothing but to go away echoed the guidestop said fogg  i am only due at allahabad tomorrow before noonbut what can you hope to do asked sir francis  in a few hoursit will be daylight andthe chance which now seems lost may present itself at the last momentsir francis would have liked to read phileas foggs eyeswhat was this cool englishman thinking of  was he planningto make a rush for the young woman at the very momentof the sacrifice and boldly snatch her from her executionersthis would be utter folly and it was hard to admit that foggwas such a fool  sir francis consented however to remainto the end of this terrible drama  the guide led them to the rearof the glade where they were able to observe the sleeping groupsmeanwhile passepartout who had perched himself on the lower branchesof a tree was resolving an idea which had at first struck him like a flashand which was now firmly lodged in his brainhe had commenced by saying to himself what folly and then he repeatedwhy not after all  its a chance perhaps the only one and with such sotsthinking thus he slipped with the suppleness of a serpentto the lowest branches the ends of which bent almost to the groundthe hours passed and the lighter shades now announced theapproach of day though it was not yet light  this was the momentthe slumbering multitude became animated the tambourines soundedsongs and cries arose the hour of the sacrifice had comethe doors of the pagoda swung open and a bright light escapedfrom its interior in the midst of which mr fogg and sir francisespied the victim  she seemed having shaken off the stupor of intoxicationto be striving to escape from her executioner  sir franciss heart throbbedand convulsively seizing mr foggs hand found in it an open knifejust at this moment the crowd began to move  the young woman had againfallen into a stupor caused by the fumes of hemp and passed amongthe fakirs who escorted her with their wild religious criesphileas fogg and his companions mingling in the rear ranks of the crowdfollowed and in two minutes they reached the banks of the streamand stopped fifty paces from the pyre upon which still lay the rajahs corpsein the semiobscurity they saw the victim quite senseless stretched outbeside her husbands body then a torch was brought and the woodheavily soaked with oil instantly took fireat this moment sir francis and the guide seized phileas fogg whoin an instant of mad generosity was about to rush upon the pyrebut he had quickly pushed them aside when the whole scene suddenly changeda cry of terror arose  the whole multitude prostrated themselvesterrorstricken on the groundthe old rajah was not dead then since he rose of a suddenlike a spectre took up his wife in his arms and descended fromthe pyre in the midst of the clouds of smoke which onlyheightened his ghostly appearancefakirs and soldiers and priests seized with instant terrorlay there with their faces on the ground not daring to lifttheir eyes and behold such a prodigythe inanimate victim was borne along by the vigorous arms whichsupported her and which she did not seem in the least to burdenmr fogg and sir francis stood erect the parsee bowed his headand passepartout was no doubt scarcely less stupefiedthe resuscitated rajah approached sir francis and mr foggand in an abrupt tone said let us be offit was passepartout himself who had slipped upon the pyrein the midst of the smoke and profiting by the stilloverhanging darkness had delivered the young woman from deathit was passepartout who playing his part with a happy audacityhad passed through the crowd amid the general terrora moment after all four of the party had disappeared in the woodsand the elephant was bearing them away at a rapid pace but the criesand noise and a ball which whizzed through phileas foggs hatapprised them that the trick had been discoveredthe old rajahs body indeed now appeared upon the burning pyreand the priests recovered from their terror perceived that an abductionhad taken place  they hastened into the forest followed by the soldierswho fired a volley after the fugitives but the latter rapidly increasedthe distance between them and ere long found themselves beyond the reachof the bullets and arrowschapter xivin which phileas fogg descends the whole length of the beautifulvalley of the ganges without ever thinking of seeing itthe rash exploit had been accomplished and for an hourpassepartout laughed gaily at his success  sir francis pressedthe worthy fellows hand and his master said well done whichfrom him was high commendation to which passepartout repliedthat all the credit of the affair belonged to mr fogg  as for himhe had only been struck with a queer idea and he laughedto think that for a few moments he passepartout the exgymnastexsergeant fireman had been the spouse of a charming womana venerable embalmed rajah  as for the young indian womanshe had been unconscious throughout of what was passing and nowwrapped up in a travellingblanket was reposing in one of the howdahsthe elephant thanks to the skilful guidance of the parseewas advancing rapidly through the still darksome forest andan hour after leaving the pagoda had crossed a vast plainthey made a halt at seven oclock the young woman being stillin a state of complete prostration  the guide made her drink a littlebrandy and water but the drowsiness which stupefied her could notyet be shaken off  sir francis who was familiar with the effectsof the intoxication produced by the fumes of hemp reassured hiscompanions on her account  but he was more disturbed at theprospect of her future fate  he told phileas fogg thatshould aouda remain in india she would inevitably fall againinto the hands of her executioners  these fanatics were scatteredthroughout the county and would despite the english policerecover their victim at madras bombay or calcutta  she wouldonly be safe by quitting india for everphileas fogg replied that he would reflect upon the matterthe station at allahabad was reached about ten oclock andthe interrupted line of railway being resumed would enable themto reach calcutta in less than twentyfour hours  phileas foggwould thus be able to arrive in time to take the steamer whichleft calcutta the next day october th at noon for hong kongthe young woman was placed in one of the waitingrooms of the stationwhilst passepartout was charged with purchasing for her various articlesof toilet a dress shawl and some furs for which his master gave himunlimited credit  passepartout started off forthwith and found himselfin the streets of allahabad that is the city of god one of the mostvenerated in india being built at the junction of the two sacred riversganges and jumna the waters of which attract pilgrims from every partof the peninsula  the ganges according to the legends of the ramayanarises in heaven whence owing to brahmas agency it descends to the earthpassepartout made it a point as he made his purchases to takea good look at the city  it was formerly defended by a noble fortwhich has since become a state prison its commerce has dwindled awayand passepartout in vain looked about him for such a bazaar as he usedto frequent in regent street  at last he came upon an elderlycrusty jew who sold secondhand articles and from whom he purchaseda dress of scotch stuff a large mantle and a fine otterskin pelissefor which he did not hesitate to pay seventyfive pounds  he thenreturned triumphantly to the stationthe influence to which the priests of pillaji had subjected aoudabegan gradually to yield and she became more herselfso that her fine eyes resumed all their soft indian expressionwhen the poetking ucaf uddaul celebrates the charmsof the queen of ahmehnagara he speaks thusher shining tresses divided in two parts encircle the harmoniouscontour of her white and delicate cheeks brilliant in their glowand freshness  her ebony brows have the form and charm of the bow of kamathe god of love and beneath her long silken lashes the purest reflectionsand a celestial light swim as

the silken folds of her tunicshe seems to have been modelled in pure silver by the godlike handof vicvarcarma the immortal sculptorit is enough to say without applying this poetical rhapsody to aoudathat she was a charming woman in all the european acceptation of the phraseshe spoke english with great purity and the guide had not exaggeratedin saying that the young parsee had been transformed by her bringing upthe train was about to start from allahabad and mr foggproceeded to pay the guide the price agreed upon for his serviceand not a farthing more which astonished passepartoutwho remembered all that his master owed to the guides devotionhe had indeed risked his life in the adventure at pillaji andif he should be caught afterwards by the indians he would withdifficulty escape their vengeance  kiouni also must be disposed ofwhat should be done with the elephant which had been so dearly purchasedphileas fogg had already determined this questionparsee said he to the guide you have been serviceable and devotedi have paid for your service but not for your devotion  would you liketo have this elephant  he is yoursthe guides eyes glistenedyour honour is giving me a fortune cried hetake him guide returned mr fogg and i shall still be your debtorgood exclaimed passepartout  take him friend  kiouni is a braveand faithful beast  and going up to the

words her fine eyes interpreted her gratitude betterthan her lips  then as her thoughts strayed back to the sceneof the sacrifice and recalled the dangers which still menaced hershe shuddered with terrorphileas fogg understood what was passing in aoudas mind and offeredin order to reassure her to escort her to hong kong where she might remainsafely until the affair was hushed upan offer which

voyagehe was unwilling to leave her while they were still on dangerous groundjust as he was leaving the station a policeman came up to him and saidmr phileas foggi am heis this man your servant added the policeman pointing to passepartoutyesbe so good both of you as to follow memr fogg betrayed no surprise whatever  the policeman was arepresentative of the law and law is sacred to an englishmanpassepartout tried to reason about the matter but the policemantapped him with his stick and mr fogg made him a signal to obeymay this young lady go with us asked heshe may replied the policemanmr fogg aouda and passepartout were conducted to a palkigahria sort of fourwheeled carriage drawn by two horses in which theytook their places and were driven away  no one spoke duringthe twenty minutes which elapsed before they reached their destinationthey first passed through the black town with its narrow streetsits miserable dirty huts and squalid population then through theeuropean town which presented a relief in its bright brick mansionsshaded by coconuttrees and bristling with masts where although it wasearly morning elegantly dressed horsemen and handsome equipageswere passing back and forththe carriage stopped before a modestlooking house whichhowever did not have the appearance of a private mansionthe policeman having requested his prisoners for so trulythey might be calledto descend conducted them into a roomwith barred windows and said  you will appear beforejudge obadiah at halfpast eighthe then retired and closed the doorwhy we are prisoners exclaimed passepartout falling into a chairaouda with an emotion she tried to conceal said to mr foggsir you must leave me to my fate  it is on my account thatyou receive this treatment it is for having saved mephileas fogg contented himself with saying that it was impossibleit was quite unlikely that he should be arrested for preventing a sutteethe complainants would not dare present themselves with such a chargethere was some mistake  moreover he would not in any eventabandon aouda but would escort her to hong kongbut the steamer leaves at noon observed passepartout nervouslywe shall be on board by noon replied his master placidlyit was said so positively that passepartout could not helpmuttering to himself parbleu thats certain  before noonwe shall be on board  but he was by no means reassuredat halfpast eight the door opened the policeman appeared andrequesting them to follow him led the way to an adjoining hallit was evidently a courtroom and a crowd of europeans and nativesalready occupied the rear of the apartmentmr fogg and his two companions took their places on abench opposite the desks of the magistrate and his clerkimmediately after judge obadiah a fat round man followed bythe clerk entered  he proceeded to take down a wig which washanging on a nail and put it hurriedly on his headthe first case said he  then putting his hand to hishead he exclaimed heh  this is not my wigno your worship returned the clerk it is minemy dear mr oysterpuff how can a judge give a wise sentencein a clerks wigthe wigs were exchangedpassepartout was getting nervous for the hands on the face of the big clockover the judge seemed to go around with terrible rapiditythe first case repeated judge obadiahphileas fogg demanded oysterpuffi am here replied mr foggpassepartoutpresent responded passepartoutgood said the judge  you have been looked for prisonersfor two days on the trains from bombaybut of what are we accused asked passepartout impatientlyyou are about to be informedi am an english subject sir said mr fogg and i have the righthave you been illtreatednot at allvery well let the complainants come ina door was swung open by order of the judge and three indian priests enteredthats it muttered passepartout these are the rogueswho were going to burn our young ladythe priests took their places in front of the judge and the clerkproceeded to read in a loud voice a complaint of sacrilege againstphileas fogg and his servant who were accused of having violateda place held consecrated by the brahmin religionyou hear the charge asked the judgeyes sir replied mr fogg consulting his watch and i admit ityou admit iti admit it and i wish to hear these priests admit in their turnwhat they were going to do at the pagoda of pillajithe priests looked at each other they did not seem to understandwhat was saidyes cried passepartout warmly at the pagoda of pillajiwhere they were on the point of burning their victimthe judge stared with astonishment and the priests were stupefiedwhat victim said judge obadiah  burn whom  in bombay itselfbombay cried passepartoutcertainly  we are not talking of the pagoda of pillaji but of the pagodaof malabar hill at bombayand as a proof added the clerk here are the desecrators very shoeswhich he left behind himwhereupon he placed a pair of shoes on his deskmy shoes cried passepartout in his surprise permittingthis imprudent exclamation to escape himthe confusion of master and man who had quite forgotten theaffair at bombay for which they were now detained at calcuttamay be imaginedfix the detective had foreseen the advantage which passepartoutsescapade gave him and delaying his departure for twelve hourshad consulted the priests of malabar hill  knowing that the englishauthorities dealt very severely with this kind of misdemeanourhe promised them a goodly sum in damages and sent them forwardto calcutta by the next train  owing to the delay caused by the rescueof the young widow fix and the priests reached the indian capital beforemr fogg and his servant the magistrates having been already warnedby a dispatch to arrest them should they arrive  fixs disappointmentwhen he learned that phileas fogg had not made his appearance in calcuttamay be imagined  he made up his mind that the robber had stoppedsomewhere on the route and taken refuge in the southern provincesfor twentyfour hours fix watched the station with feverish anxietyat last he was rewarded by seeing mr fogg and passepartout arriveaccompanied by a young woman whose presence he was wholly at a lossto explain  he hastened for a policeman and this was how the party cameto be arrested and brought before judge obadiahhad passepartout been a little less preoccupied he would haveespied the detective ensconced in a corner of the courtroomwatching the proceedings with an interest easily understoodfor the warrant had failed to reach him at calcuttaas it had done at bombay and suezjudge obadiah had unfortunately caught passepartouts rash exclamationwhich the poor fellow would have given the world to recallthe facts are admitted asked the judgeadmitted replied mr fogg coldlyinasmuch resumed the judge as the english law protects equallyand sternly the religions of the indian people and as the manpassepartout has admitted that he violated the sacred pagoda of malabar hillat bombay on the th of october i condemn the said passepartoutto imprisonment for fifteen days and a fine of three hundred poundsthree hundred pounds cried passepartout startled at the largenessof the sumsilence shouted the constableand inasmuch continued the judge as it is not proved thatthe act was not done by the connivance of the master with the servantand as the master in any case must be held responsible for the actsof his paid servant i condemn phileas fogg to a weeks imprisonmentand a fine of one hundred and fifty poundsfix rubbed his hands softly with satisfaction if phileas foggcould be detained in calcutta a week it would be more than timefor the warrant to arrive  passepartout was stupefied  this sentenceruined his master  a wager of twenty thousand pounds lost because helike a precious fool had gone into that abominable pagodaphileas fogg as selfcomposed as if the judgment did notin the least concern him did not even lift his eyebrows whileit was being pronounced  just as the clerk was calling the next casehe rose and said i offer bailyou have that right returned the judgefixs blood ran cold but he resumed his composure when he heardthe judge announce that the bail required for each prisonerwould be one thousand poundsi will pay it at once said mr fogg taking a roll of bankbillsfrom the carpetbag which passepartout had by him and placing themon the clerks deskthis sum will be restored to you upon your release from prisonsaid the judge  meanwhile you are liberated on bailcome said phileas fogg to his servantbut let them at least give me back my shoes cried passepartout angrilyah these are pretty dear shoes he muttered as they were handed to himmore than a thousand pounds apiece besides they pinch my feetmr fogg offering his arm to aouda then departed followedby the crestfallen passepartout  fix still nourished hopesthat the robber would not after all leave the two thousand poundsbehind him but would decide to serve out his week in jailand issued forth on mr foggs traces  that gentleman took a carriageand the party were soon landed on one of the quaysthe rangoon was moored half a mile off in the harbour its signalof departure hoisted at the masthead  eleven oclock was strikingmr fogg was an hour in advance of time  fix saw them leave the carriage andpush off in a boat for the steamer and stamped his feet with disappointmentthe rascal is off after all he exclaimed  two thousand pounds sacrificedhes as prodigal as a thief  ill follow him to the end of the worldif necessary but at the rate he is going on the stolen money willsoon be exhaustedthe detective was not far wrong in making this conjecturesince leaving london what with travelling expenses bribesthe purchase of the elephant bails and fines mr fogghad already spent more than five thousand pounds on the wayand the percentage of the sum recovered from the bank robberpromised to the detectives was rapidly diminishingchapter xviin which fix does not seem to understandin the least what is said to himthe rangoonone of the peninsular and oriental companys boatsplying in the chinese and japanese seaswas a screw steamerbuilt of iron weighing about seventeen hundred and seventy tonsand with engines of four hundred horsepower  she was as fastbut not as well fitted up as the mongolia and aouda was not ascomfortably provided for on board of her as phileas fogg could have wishedhowever the trip from calcutta to hong kong only comprised somethree thousand five hundred miles occupying from ten to twelve daysand the young woman was not difficult to pleaseduring the first days of the journey aouda became better acquaintedwith her protector and constantly gave evidence of her deep gratitudefor what he had done  the phlegmatic gentleman listened to herapparently at least with coldness neither his voice nor his mannerbetraying the slightest emotion but he seemed to be always on the watchthat nothing should be wanting to aoudas comfort  he visited herregularly each day at certain hours not so much to talk himselfas to sit and hear her talk  he treated her with the strictest politenessbut with the precision of an automaton the movements of which had beenarranged for this purpose  aouda did not quite know what to make of himthough passepartout had given her some hints of his masters eccentricityand made her smile by telling her of the wager which was sending himround the world  after all she owed phileas fogg her life and shealways regarded him through the exalting medium of her gratitudeaouda confirmed the parsee guides narrative of her touching historyshe did indeed belong to the highest of the native races of indiamany of the parsee merchants have made great fortunes there by dealingin cotton and one of them sir jametsee jeejeebhoy was made a baronetby the english government  aouda was a relative of this great manand it was his cousin jeejeeh whom she hoped to join at hong kongwhether she would find a protector in him she could not tellbut mr fogg essayed to calm her anxieties and to assure her thateverything would be mathematicallyhe used the very wordarrangedaouda fastened her great eyes clear as thee sacred lakes of the himalayaupon him but the intractable fogg as reserved as ever did not seemat all inclined to throw himself into this lakethe first few days of the voyage passed prosperously amid favourableweather and propitious winds and they soon came in sight ofthe great andaman the principal of the islands in the bay of bengalwith its picturesque saddle peak two thousand four hundred feet highlooming above the waters  the steamer passed along near the shoresbut the savage papuans who are in the lowest scale of humanitybut are not as has been asserted cannibals did not make their appearancethe panorama of the islands as they steamed by them was superbvast forests of palms arecs bamboo teakwood of the gigantic mimosaand treelike ferns covered the foreground while behind the graceful outlinesof the mountains were traced against the sky and along the coasts swarmedby thousands the precious swallows whose nests furnish a luxurious dishto the tables of the celestial empire  the varied landscape afforded bythe andaman islands was soon passed however and the rangoon rapidlyapproached the straits of malacca which gave access to the china seaswhat was detective fix so unluckily drawn on from country to countrydoing all this while  he had managed to embark on the rangoon at calcuttawithout being seen by passepartout after leaving orders thatif the warrant should arrive it should be forwarded to him at hong kongand he hoped to conceal his presence to the end of the voyageit would have been difficult to explain why he was on boardwithout awakening passepartouts suspicions who thought him still at bombaybut necessity impelled him nevertheless to renew his acquaintancewith the worthy servant as will be seenall the detectives hopes and wishes were now centred on hong kongfor the steamers stay at singapore would be too brief to enablehim to take any steps there  the arrest must be made at hong kongor the robber would probably escape him for ever  hong kong wasthe last english ground on which he would set foot beyond chinajapan america offered to fogg an almost certain refugeif the warrant should at last make its appearance at hong kongfix could arrest him and give him into the hands of the local policeand there would be no further trouble  but beyond hong konga simple warrant would be of no avail an extradition warrantwould be necessary and that would result in delays and obstaclesof which the rascal would take advantage to elude justicefix thought over these probabilities during the long hourswhich he spent in his cabin and kept repeating to himselfnow either the warrant will be at hong kong in which casei shall arrest my man or it will not be there and this timeit is absolutely necessary that i should delay his departurei have failed at bombay and i have failed at calcutta if i failat hong kong my reputation is lost  cost what it may i must succeedbut how shall i prevent his departure if that should turn out to bemy last resourcefix made up his mind that if worst came to worst he would makea confidant of passepartout and tell him what kind of a fellowhis master really was  that passepartout was not foggs accomplicehe was very certain  the servant enlightened by his disclosureand afraid of being himself implicated in the crime would doubtlessbecome an ally of the detective  but this method was a dangerous oneonly to be employed when everything else had failed  a word frompassepartout to his master would ruin all  the detective was thereforein a sore strait  but suddenly a new idea struck him  the presenceof aouda on the rangoon in company with phileas fogg gave himnew material for reflectionwho was this woman  what combination of events had made her foggstravelling companion  they had evidently met somewhere between bombayand calcutta but where  had they met accidentally or had fogg goneinto the interior purposely in quest of this charming damselfix was fairly puzzled  he asked himself whether there had notbeen a wicked elopement and this idea so impressed itselfupon his mind that he determined to make use of the supposed intriguewhether the young woman were married or not he would be able to createsuch difficulties for mr fogg at hong kong that he could not escapeby paying any amount of moneybut could he even wait till they reached hong kong  fogg had anabominable way of jumping from one boat to another and before anythingcould be effected might get full under way again for yokohamafix decided that he must warn the english authorities and signalthe rangoon before her arrival  this was easy to do since the steamerstopped at singapore whence there is a telegraphic wire to hong konghe finally resolved moreover before acting more positivelyto question passepartout  it would not be difficult to make him talkand as there was no time to lose fix prepared to make himself knownit was now the th of october and on the following day the rangoonwas due at singaporefix emerged from his cabin and went on deck  passepartout waspromenading up and down in the forward part of the steamerthe detective rushed forward with every appearance of extremesurprise and exclaimed you here on the rangoonwhat monsieur fix are you on board returned the reallyastonished passepartout recognising his crony of the mongoliawhy i left you at bombay and here you are on the way to hong kongare you going round the world toono no replied fix i shall stop at hong kongat least for some dayshum said passepartout who seemed for an instant perplexedbut how is it i have not seen you on board since we left calcuttaoh a trifle of seasicknessive been staying in my berththe gulf of bengal does not agree with me as well as the indian oceanand how is mr foggas well and as punctual as ever not a day behind timebut monsieur fix you dont know that we have a young lady with usa young lady replied the detective not seeming to comprehendwhat was saidpassepartout thereupon recounted aoudas history the affairat the bombay pagoda the purchase of the elephant fortwo thousand pounds the rescue the arrest and sentenceof the calcutta court and the restoration of mr foggand himself to liberty on bail  fix who was familiarwith the last events seemed to be equally ignorant of allthat passepartout related and the later was charmedto find so interested a listenerbut does your master propose to carry this young woman to europenot at all  we are simply going to place her under the protectionof one of her relatives a rich merchant at hong kongnothing to be done there said fix to himself concealing his disappointmenta glass of gin mr passepartoutwillingly monsieur fix  we must at least have a friendly glasson board the rangoonchapter xviishowing what happened on the voyage from singapore to hong kongthe detective and passepartout met often on deck after this interviewthough fix was reserved and did not attempt to induce his companionto divulge any more facts concerning mr fogg  he caught a glimpseof that mysterious gentleman once or twice but mr fogg usually confinedhimself to the cabin where he kept aouda company or according to hisinveterate habit took a hand at whistpassepartout began very seriously to conjecture what strangechance kept fix still on the route that his master was pursuingit was really worth considering why this certainly very amiableand complacent person whom he had first met at suez had thenencountered on board the mongolia who disembarked at bombaywhich he announced as his destination and now turned up sounexpectedly on the rangoon was following mr foggs tracks stepby step  what was fixs object  passepartout was ready to wager hisindian shoeswhich he religiously preservedthat fix would also leavehong kong at the same time with them and probably on the same steamerpassepartout might have cudgelled his brain for a century withouthitting upon the real object which the detective had in viewhe never could have imagined that phileas fogg was being trackedas a robber around the globe  but as it is in human nature to attemptthe solution of every mystery passepartout suddenly discoveredan explanation of fixs movements which was in truth far from unreasonablefix he thought could only be an agent of mr foggs friendsat the reform club sent to follow him up and to ascertainthat he really went round the world as had been agreed uponits clear repeated the worthy servant to himself proud of his shrewdnesshes a spy sent to keep us in view  that isnt quite the thing eitherto be spying mr fogg who is so honourable a man  ah gentlemen of the reformthis shall cost you dearpassepartout enchanted with his discovery resolved to saynothing to his master lest he should be justly offended at thismistrust on the part of his adversaries  but he determinedto chaff fix when he had the chance with mysterious allusionswhich however need not betray his real suspicionsduring the afternoon of wednesday th october the rangoonentered the strait of malacca which separates the peninsulaof that name from sumatra  the mountainous and craggy isletsintercepted the beauties of this noble island from the viewof the travellers  the rangoon weighed anchor at singapore the next dayat four am to receive coal having gained half a day on the prescribedtime of her arrival  phileas fogg noted this gain in his journal and thenaccompanied by aouda who betrayed a desire for a walk on shore disembarkedfix who suspected mr foggs every movement followed them cautiouslywithout being himself perceived while passepartout laughing in his sleeveat fixs manoeuvres went about his usual errandsthe island of singapore is not imposing in aspect for there areno mountains yet its appearance is not without attractionsit is a park checkered by pleasant highways and avenuesa handsome carriage drawn by a sleek pair of new holland horsescarried phileas fogg and aouda into the midst of rows of palmswith brilliant foliage and of clovetrees whereof the clovesform the heart of a halfopen flower  pepper plants replacedthe prickly hedges of european fields sagobushes large fernswith gorgeous branches varied the aspect of this tropical climewhile nutmegtrees in full foliage filled the air with a penetrating perfumeagile and grinning bands of monkeys skipped about in the trees nor were tigerswanting in the junglesafter a drive of two hours through the country aouda and mr foggreturned to the town which is a vast collection of heavylookingirregular houses surrounded by charming gardens rich in tropical fruitsand plants and at ten oclock they reembarked closely followed bythe detective who had kept them constantly in sightpassepartout who had been purchasing several dozen mangoesa fruit as large as goodsized apples of a darkbrown colouroutside and a bright red within and whose white pulp melting inthe mouth affords gourmands a delicious sensationwas waitingfor them on deck  he was only too glad to offer some mangoesto aouda who thanked him very gracefully for themat eleven oclock the rangoon rode out of singapore harbourand in a few hours the high mountains of malacca with their forestsinhabited by the most beautifullyfurred tigers in the worldwere lost to view  singapore is distant some thirteen hundred milesfrom the island of hong kong which is a little english colonynear the chinese coast  phileas fogg hoped to accomplish the journeyin six days so as to be in time for the steamer which would leaveon the th of november for yokohama the principal japanese portthe rangoon had a large quota of passengers many of whom disembarkedat singapore among them a number of indians ceylonese chinamenmalays and portuguese mostly secondclass travellersthe weather which had hitherto been fine changed with thelast quarter of the moon  the sea rolled heavily and the windat intervals rose almost to a storm but happily blew fromthe southwest and thus aided the steamers progressthe captain as often as possible put up his sailsand under the double action of steam and sail the vessel maderapid progress along the coasts of anam and cochin chinaowing to the defective construction of the rangoon howeverunusual precautions became necessary in unfavourable weatherbut the loss of time which resulted from this cause while itnearly drove passepartout out of his senses did not seemto affect his master in the least  passepartout blamed the captainthe engineer and the crew and consigned all who were connectedwith the ship to the land where the pepper grows  perhaps the thoughtof the gas which was remorselessly burning at his expense in saville rowhad something to do with his hot impatienceyou are in a great hurry then said fix to him one day to reach hong konga very great hurrymr fogg i suppose is anxious to catch the steamer for yokohamaterribly anxiousyou believe in this journey around the world thenabsolutely  dont you mr fixi  i dont believe a word of ityoure a sly dog said passepartout winking at himthis expression rather disturbed fix without his knowing whyhad the frenchman guessed his real purpose  he knew not whatto think  but how could passepartout have discovered that hewas a detective  yet in speaking as he did the man evidentlymeant more than he expressedpassepartout went still further the next day he could not hold his tonguemr fix said he in a bantering tone shall we be so unfortunateas to lose you when we get to hong kongwhy responded fix a little embarrassed i dont know perhapsah if you would only go on with us  an agent of the peninsular companyyou know cant stop on the way  you were only going to bombayand here you are in china  america is not far off and from americato europe is only a stepfix looked intently at his companion whose countenance wasas serene as possible and laughed with him  but passepartoutpersisted in chaffing him by asking him if he made much by hispresent occupationyes and no returned fix there is good and bad luck in such thingsbut you must understand that i dont travel at my own expenseoh i am quite sure of that cried passepartout laughing heartilyfix fairly puzzled descended to his cabin and gave himselfup to his reflections  he was evidently suspected somehowor other the frenchman had found out that he was a detectivebut had he told his master  what part was he playing in all thiswas he an accomplice or not  was the game then up  fix spentseveral hours turning these things over in his mind sometimesthinking that all was lost then persuading himself that foggwas ignorant of his presence and then undecided what courseit was best to takenevertheless he preserved his coolness of mind and at lastresolved to deal plainly with passepartout  if he did not find itpracticable to arrest fogg at hong kong and if fogg made preparationsto leave that last foothold of english territory he fix would tellpassepartout all  either the servant was the accomplice of his masterand in this case the master knew of his operations and he should failor else the servant knew nothing about the robbery and then his interestwould be to abandon the robbersuch was the situation between fix and passepartout  meanwhile phileas foggmoved about above them in the most majestic and unconscious indifferencehe was passing methodically in his orbit around the world regardless ofthe lesser stars which gravitated around him  yet there was near by whatthe astronomers would call a disturbing star which might have producedan agitation in this gentlemans heart  but no the charms of aoudafailed to act to passepartouts great surprise and the disturbancesif they existed would have been more difficult to calculate than thoseof uranus which led to the discovery of neptuneit was every day an increasing wonder to passepartout who readin aoudas eyes the depths of her gratitude to his masterphileas fogg though brave and gallant must be he thoughtquite heartless  as to the sentiment which this journey mighthave awakened in him there was clearly no trace of such a thingwhile poor passepartout existed in perpetual reveriesone day he was leaning on the railing of the engineroomand was observing the engine when a sudden pitch of the steamerthrew the screw out of the water  the steam came hissing outof the valves and this made passepartout indignantthe valves are not sufficiently charged he exclaimed  we arenot going  oh these english  if this was an american craftwe should blow up perhaps but we should at all events go fasterchapter xviiiin which phileas fogg passepartout and fix go each about his businessthe weather was bad during the latter days of the voyagethe wind obstinately remaining in the northwest blew a galeand retarded the steamer  the rangoon rolled heavily and thepassengers became impatient of the long monstrous waves whichthe wind raised before their path  a sort of tempest arose onthe rd of november the squall knocking the vessel about with furyand the waves running high  the rangoon reefed all her sails and eventhe rigging proved too much whistling and shaking amid the squallthe steamer was forced to proceed slowly and the captain estimatedthat she would reach hong kong twenty hours behind time and moreif the storm lastedphileas fogg gazed at the tempestuous sea which seemed to be strugglingespecially to delay him with his habitual tranquillity  he never changedcountenance for an instant though a delay of twenty hours by making himtoo late for the yokohama boat would almost inevitably cause the lossof the wager  but this man of nerve manifested neither impatiencenor annoyance it seemed as if the storm were a part of his programmeand had been foreseen  aouda was amazed to find him as calm as he had beenfrom the first time she saw himfix did not look at the state of things in the same lightthe storm greatly pleased him  his satisfaction would havebeen complete had the rangoon been forced to retreat beforethe violence of wind and waves  each delay filled him with hopefor it became more and more probable that fogg would be obligedto remain some days at hong kong and now the heavens themselvesbecame his allies with the gusts and squalls  it mattered notthat they made him seasickhe made no account of this inconvenienceand whilst his body was writhing under their effects his spirit boundedwith hopeful exultationpassepartout was enraged beyond expression by the unpropitious weathereverything had gone so well till now  earth and sea had seemed to beat his masters service steamers and railways obeyed

going to lastwhereupon he was referred to the barometer which seemed to haveno intention of rising  passepartout shook it but with noperceptible effect for neither shaking nor maledictionscould

passionmr fogg bolder than his servant did not hesitate to approach the pilotand tranquilly ask him if he knew when a steamer would leave hong kongfor yokohamaat high tide tomorrow morning answered the pilotah said mr fogg without betraying any astonishmentpassepartout who heard what passed would willingly have embraced the pilotwhile fix would have been glad to twist his neckwhat is the steamers name asked mr foggthe carnaticought she not to have gone yesterdayyes sir but they had to repair one of her boilersand so her departure was postponed till tomorrowthank you returned mr fogg descending mathematically to the saloonpassepartout clasped the pilots hand and shook it heartily in his delightexclaiming pilot you are the best of good fellowsthe pilot probably does not know to this day why his responseswon him this enthusiastic greeting  he remounted the bridgeand guided the steamer through the flotilla of junkstankas and fishing boats which crowd the harbour of hong kongat one oclock the rangoon was at the quay and the passengerswere going ashorechance had strangely favoured phileas fogg for had not thecarnatic been forced to lie over for repairing her boilersshe would have left on the th of november and the passengersfor japan would have been obliged to await for a week the sailingof the next steamer  mr fogg was it is true twentyfour hoursbehind his time but this could not seriously imperil theremainder of his tourthe steamer which crossed the pacific from yokohama to san franciscomade a direct connection with that from hong kong and it could not sailuntil the latter reached yokohama and if mr fogg was twentyfour hourslate on reaching yokohama this time would no doubt be easily regainedin the voyage of twentytwo days across the pacific  he found himselfthen about twentyfour hours behindhand thirtyfive daysafter leaving londonthe carnatic was announced to leave hong kong at five the next morningmr fogg had sixteen hours in which to attend to his business therewhich was to deposit aouda safely with her wealthy relativeon landing he conducted her to a palanquin in which theyrepaired to the club hotel  a room was engaged for the young womanand mr fogg after seeing that she wanted for nothing set out in searchof her cousin jeejeeh  he instructed passepartout to remain at the hoteluntil his return that aouda might not be left entirely alonemr fogg repaired to the exchange where he did not doubtevery one would know so wealthy and considerable a personageas the parsee merchant  meeting a broker he made the inquiryto learn that jeejeeh had left china two years before and retiringfrom business with an immense fortune had taken up his residencein europein holland the broker thought with the merchantsof which country he had principally traded  phileas fogg returnedto the hotel begged a moments conversation with aouda and withoutmore ado apprised her that jeejeeh was no longer at hong kongbut probably in hollandaouda at first said nothing  she passed her hand across her foreheadand reflected a few moments  then in her sweet soft voice she saidwhat ought i to do mr foggit is very simple responded the gentleman  go on to europebut i cannot intrudeyou do not intrude nor do you in the least embarrass my projectpassepartoutmonsieurgo to the carnatic and engage three cabinspassepartout delighted that the young woman who was very gracious to himwas going to continue the journey with them went off at a brisk gaitto obey his masters orderchapter xixin which passepartout takes a too great interest in his masterand what comes of ithong kong is an island which came into the possession of theenglish by the treaty of nankin after the war of and the colonising genius of the english has created upon itan important city and an excellent port  the island is situatedat the mouth of the canton river and is separated by about sixty milesfrom the portuguese town of macao on the opposite coast  hong konghas beaten macao in the

macadamised streetsgive to hong kong the appearance of a town in kent or surreytransferred by some strange magic to the antipodespassepartout wandered with his hands in his pockets towards thevictoria port gazing as he went at the curious palanquinsand other modes of conveyance and the groups of chinese japaneseand europeans who passed to and fro in the streets  hong kong seemedto him not unlike bombay calcutta and singapore since like themit betrayed everywhere the evidence of english supremacyat the victoria port he found a confused mass of ships of all nationsenglish french american and dutch menofwar and trading vesselsjapanese and chinese junks sempas tankas and flowerboatswhich formed so many floating parterres  passepartout noticedin the crowd a number of the natives who seemed very oldand were dressed in yellow  on going into a barbersto get shaved he learned that these ancient men were allat least eighty years old at which age they are permittedto wear yellow which is the imperial colour  passepartoutwithout exactly knowing why thought this very funnyon reaching the quay where they were to embark on the carnatiche was not astonished to find fix walking up and downthe detective seemed very much disturbed and disappointedthis is bad muttered passepartout for the gentlemen ofthe reform club  he accosted fix with a merry smile as if hehad not perceived that gentlemans chagrin  the detective had indeedgood reasons to inveigh against the bad luck which pursued himthe warrant had not come  it was certainly on the waybut as certainly it could not now reach hong kong for several daysand this being the last english territory on mr foggs routethe robber would escape unless he could manage to detain himwell monsieur fix said passepartout have you decided to go with usso far as americayes returned fix through his set teethgood exclaimed passepartout laughing heartilyi knew you could not persuade yourself to separate from uscome and engage your berththey entered the steamer office and secured cabins for four personsthe clerk as he gave them the tickets informed them thatthe repairs on the carnatic having been completed the steamerwould leave that very evening and not next morning as had been announcedthat will suit my master all the better said passepartouti will go and let him knowfix now decided to make a bold move he resolved to tell passepartout allit seemed to be the only possible means of keeping phileas fogg several dayslonger at hong kong  he accordingly invited his companion into a tavernwhich caught his eye on the quay  on entering they found themselvesin a large room handsomely decorated at the end of which was a largecampbed furnished with cushions  several persons lay upon this bedin a deep sleep  at the small tables which were arranged about the roomsome thirty customers were drinking english beer porter gin and brandysmoking the while long red clay pipes stuffed with little balls of opiummingled with essence of rose  from time to time one of the smokersovercome with the narcotic would slip under the table whereupon the waiterstaking him by the head and feet carried and laid him upon the bedthe bed already supported twenty of these stupefied sotsfix and passepartout saw that they were in a smokinghouse hauntedby those wretched cadaverous idiotic creatures to whom the englishmerchants sell every year the miserable drug called opiumto the amount of one million four hundred thousand poundsthousands devoted to one of the most despicable viceswhich afflict humanity  the chinese government has in vainattempted to deal with the evil by stringent laws  it passedgradually from the rich to whom it was at first exclusively reservedto the lower classes and then its ravages could not be arrestedopium is smoked everywhere at all times by men and womenin the celestial empire and once accustomed to it the victimscannot dispense with it except by suffering horrible bodily contortionsand agonies  a great smoker can smoke as many as eight pipes a daybut he dies in five years  it was in one of these dens that fixand passepartout in search of a friendly glass found themselvespassepartout had no money but willingly accepted fixs invitationin the hope of returning the obligation at some future timethey ordered two bottles of port to which the frenchman did ample justicewhilst fix observed him with close attention  they chatted about the journeyand passepartout was especially merry at the idea that fix was going tocontinue it with them  when the bottles were empty howeverhe rose to go and tell his master of the change in the timeof the sailing of the carnaticfix caught him by the arm and said wait a momentwhat for mr fixi want to have a serious talk with youa serious talk cried passepartout drinking up the little winethat was left in the bottom of his glass  well well talkabout it tomorrow i havent time nowstay  what i have to say concerns your masterpassepartout at this looked attentively at his companionfixs face seemed to have a singular expression  he resumed his seatwhat is it that you have to sayfix placed his hand upon passepartouts arm andlowering his voice said you have guessed who i amparbleu said passepartout smilingthen im going to tell you everythingnow that i know everything my friend  ah thats very goodbut go on go on  first though let me tell you that thosegentlemen have put themselves to a useless expenseuseless said fix  you speak confidently  its clear thatyou dont know how large the sum isof course i do returned passepartout  twenty thousand poundsfiftyfive thousand answered fix pressing his companions handwhat cried the frenchman  has monsieur fogg daredfiftyfive thousand pounds  well theres all the more reasonfor not losing an instant he continued getting up hastilyfix pushed passepartout back in his chair and resumedfiftyfive thousand pounds and if i succeed i get two thousand poundsif youll help me ill let you have five hundred of themhelp you cried passepartout whose eyes were standing wide openyes help me keep mr fogg here for two or three dayswhy what are you saying  those gentlemen are not satisfiedwith following my master and suspecting his honour but they musttry to put obstacles in his way  i blush for themwhat do you meani mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery  they mightas well waylay mr fogg and put his money in their pocketsthats just what we count on doingits a conspiracy then cried passepartout who became moreand more excited as the liquor mounted in his head for he drankwithout perceiving it  a real conspiracy  and gentlemen too bahfix began to be puzzledmembers of the reform club continued passepartout  you must knowmonsieur fix that my master is an honest man and thatwhen he makes a wager he tries to win it fairlybut who do you think i am asked fix looking at him intentlyparbleu  an agent of the members of the reform club sent out hereto interrupt my masters journey  but though i found you out some time agoive taken good care to say nothing about it to mr fogghe knows nothing thennothing replied passepartout again emptying his glassthe detective passed his hand across his forehead hesitating beforehe spoke again  what should he do  passepartouts mistake seemed sincerebut it made his design more difficult  it was evident that the servantwas not the masters accomplice as fix had been inclined to suspectwell said the detective to himself as he is not an accomplicehe will help mehe had no time to lose fogg must be detained at hong kongso he resolved to make a clean breast of itlisten to me said fix abruptly  i am not as you thinkan agent of the members of the reform clubbah retorted passepartout with an air of railleryi am a police detective sent out here by the london officeyou a detectivei will prove it  here is my commissionpassepartout was speechless with astonishment when fix displayedthis document the genuineness of which could not be doubtedmr foggs wager resumed fix is only a pretext of which youand the gentlemen of the reform are dupes  he had a motivefor securing your innocent complicitybut whylisten  on the th of last september a robbery of fiftyfive thousand poundswas committed at the bank of england by a person whose descriptionwas fortunately secured  here is his description it answers exactlyto that of mr phileas foggwhat nonsense cried passepartout striking the table with his fistmy master is the most honourable of menhow can you tell  you know scarcely anything about him  you went intohis service the day he came away and he came away on a foolish pretextwithout trunks and carrying a large amount in banknotes  and yet youare bold enough to assert that he is an honest manyes yes repeated the poor fellow mechanicallywould you like to be arrested as his accomplicepassepartout overcome by what he had heard held his headbetween his hands and did not dare to look at the detectivephileas fogg the saviour of aouda that brave and generous mana robber  and yet how many presumptions there were against himpassepartout essayed to reject the suspicions which forced themselvesupon his mind he did not wish to believe that his master was guiltywell what do you want of me said he at last with an effortsee here replied fix i have tracked mr fogg to this placebut as yet i have failed to receive the warrant of arrest for whichi sent to london  you must help me to keep him here in hong kongi  but ii will share with you the two thousand pounds reward offeredby the bank of englandnever replied passepartout who tried to rise but fell backexhausted in mind and bodymr fix he stammered even should what you say be trueif my master is really the robber you are seeking forwhich i denyi have been am in his service i have seen his generosity and goodnessand i will never betray himnot for all the gold in the worldi come from a village where they dont eat that kind of breadyou refusei refuseconsider that ive said nothing said fix and let us drinkyes let us drinkpassepartout felt himself yielding more and more to the effectsof the liquor  fix seeing that he must at all hazards be separatedfrom his master wished to entirely overcome him  some pipes full of opiumlay upon the table  fix slipped one into passepartouts handhe took it put it between his lips lit it drew several puffsand his head becoming heavy under the influence of the narcoticfell upon the tableat last said fix seeing passepartout unconsciousmr fogg will not be informed of the carnatics departure andif he is he will have to go without this cursed frenchmanand after paying his bill fix left the tavernchapter xxin which fix comes face to face with phileas foggwhile these events were passing at the opiumhouse mr foggunconscious of the danger he was in of losing the steamerwas quietly escorting aouda about the streets of the english quartermaking the necessary purchases for the long voyage before themit was all very well for an englishman like mr fogg to make thetour of the world with a carpetbag a lady could not be expectedto travel comfortably under such conditions  he acquittedhis task with characteristic serenity and invariably repliedto the remonstrances of his fair companion who was confusedby his patience and generosityit is in the interest of my journeya part of my programmethe purchases made they returned to the hotel where theydined at a sumptuously served tabledhote after which aoudashaking hands with her protector after the english fashionretired to her room for rest  mr fogg absorbed himself throughoutthe evening in the perusal of the times and illustrated london newshad he been capable of being astonished at anything it wouldhave been not to see his servant return at bedtimebut knowing that the steamer was not to leave for yokohama untilthe next morning he did not disturb himself about the matterwhen passepartout did not appear the next morning to answerhis masters bell mr fogg not betraying the least vexationcontented himself with taking his carpetbag calling aoudaand sending for a palanquinit was then eight oclock at halfpast nine it being then hightide the carnatic would leave the harbour  mr fogg and aoudagot into the palanquin their luggage being brought after on a wheelbarrowand half an hour later stepped upon the quay whence they were to embarkmr fogg then learned that the carnatic had sailed the evening beforehe had expected to find not only the steamer but his domesticand was forced to give up both but no sign of disappointment appearedon his face and he merely remarked to aouda it is an accident madamnothing moreat this moment a man who had been observing him attentively approachedit was fix who bowing addressed mr fogg  were you not like mesir a passenger by the rangoon which arrived yesterdayi was sir replied mr fogg coldly  but i have not the honourpardon me i thought i should find your servant heredo you know where he is sir asked aouda anxiouslywhat responded fix feigning surprise  is he not with youno said aouda  he has not made his appearance since yesterdaycould he have gone on board the carnatic without uswithout you madam answered the detective  excuse me did you intendto sail in the carnaticyes sirso did i madam and i am excessively disappointed  the carnaticits repairs being completed left hong kong twelve hours beforethe stated time without any notice being given and we must now waita week for another steameras he said a week fix felt his heart leap for joy  fogg detainedat hong kong for a week  there would be time for the warrant to arriveand fortune at last favoured the representative of the law  his horrormay be imagined when he heard mr fogg say in his placid voicebut there are other vessels besides the carnatic it seems to mein the harbour of hong kongand offering his arm to aouda he directed his steps toward the docksin search of some craft about to start  fix stupefied followedit seemed as if he were attached to mr fogg by an invisible threadchance however appeared really to have abandoned the man it had hithertoserved so well  for three hours phileas fogg wandered about the dockswith the determination if necessary to charter a vessel to carry himto yokohama but he could only find vessels which were loading or unloadingand which could not therefore set sail  fix began to hope againbut mr fogg far from being discouraged was continuing his searchresolved not to stop if he had to resort to macao when he was accostedby a sailor on one of the wharvesis your honour looking for a boathave you a boat ready to sailyes your honour a pilotboatno the best in the harbourdoes she go fastbetween eight and nine knots the hour  will you look at heryesyour honour will be satisfied with her  is it

i must get to yokohamaby the th at the latest to take the boat for san franciscoi am sorry said the sailor but it is impossiblei offer you a hundred pounds per day and an additionalreward of two hundred pounds if i reach yokohama in timeare you in earnestvery much sothe pilot walked away a little distance and gazed out to seaevidently struggling between the anxiety to gain a large sumand the fear of venturing so far  fix was in mortal suspensemr fogg turned to aouda and asked her you would not be afraidwould you madamnot with you mr fogg was her answerthe pilot now returned shuffling his hat in his handswell pilot said mr foggwell your honour replied he i could not risk myself my menor my little boat of scarcely twenty tons on so long a voyageat this time of year  besides we could not reach yokohama in timefor it is sixteen hundred and sixty miles from hong kongonly sixteen hundred said mr foggits the same thingfix breathed more freelybut added the pilot it might be arranged another wayfix ceased to breathe at allhow asked mr foggby going to nagasaki at the extreme south of japan or evento shanghai which is only eight hundred miles from herein going to shanghai we should not be forced to sail wideof the chinese coast which would be a great advantageas the currents run northward and would aid uspilot said mr fogg i must take the american steamerat yokohama and not at shanghai or nagasakiwhy not returned the pilot  the san francisco steamerdoes not start from yokohama  it puts in at yokohamaand nagasaki but it starts from shanghaiyou are sure of thatperfectlyand when does the boat leave shanghaion the th at seven in the evening  we have thereforefour days before us that is ninetysix hours and in that timeif we had good luck and a southwest wind and the sea was calmwe could make those eight hundred miles to shanghaiand you could goin an hour as soon as provisions could be got aboardand the sails put upit is a bargain  are you the master of the boatyes john bunsby master of the tankaderewould you like some earnestmoneyif it would not put your honour outhere are two hundred pounds on account sir added phileas foggturning to fix if you would like to take advantagethanks sir i was about to ask the favourvery well  in half an hour we shall go on boardbut poor passepartout urged aouda who was much disturbedby the servants disappearancei shall do all i can to find him replied phileas foggwhile fix in a feverish nervous state repaired to the pilotboatthe others directed their course to the policestation at hong kongphileas fogg there gave passepartouts description and left a sum of moneyto be spent in the search for him  the same formalities having been gonethrough at the french consulate and the palanquin having stopped at the hotelfor the luggage which had been sent back there they returned to the wharfit was now three oclock and pilotboat no  with its crewon board and its provisions stored away was ready for departurethe tankadere was a neat little craft of twenty tonsas gracefully built as if she were a racing yachther shining copper sheathing her galvanised ironworkher deck white as ivory betrayed the pride taken by john bunsbyin making her presentable  her two masts leaned a trifle backwardshe carried brigantine foresail stormjib and standingjiband was well rigged for running before the wind and she seemed capableof brisk speed which indeed she had already proved by gainingseveral prizes in pilotboat races  the crew of the tankaderewas composed of john bunsby the master and four hardy marinerswho were familiar with the chinese seas  john bunsby himselfa man of fortyfive or thereabouts vigorous sunburnt with asprightly expression of the eye and energetic and selfreliantcountenance would have inspired confidence in the most timidphileas fogg and aouda went on board where they found fixalready installed  below deck was a square cabin of whichthe walls bulged out in the form of cots above a circular divanin the centre was a table provided with a swinging lampthe accommodation was confined but neati am sorry to have nothing better to offer you said mrfogg to fix who bowed without respondingthe detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profitingby the kindness of mr foggits certain thought he though rascal as he is he is a polite onethe sails and the english flag were hoisted at ten minutes past threemr fogg and aouda who were seated on deck cast a last glance at the quayin the hope of espying passepartout  fix was not without his fearslest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servantwhom he had so badly treated in this direction in which casean explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detectivemust have ensued  but the frenchman did not appear and without doubtwas still lying under the stupefying influence of the opiumjohn bunsby master at length gave the order to start andthe tankadere taking the wind under her brigantine foresailand standingjib bounded briskly forward over the waveschapter xxiin which the master of the tankadere runsgreat risk of losing a reward of two hundred poundsthis voyage of eight hundred miles was a perilous ventureon a craft of twenty tons and at that season of the yearthe chinese seas are usually boisterous subject to terriblegales of wind and especially during the equinoxesand it was now early novemberit would clearly have been to the masters advantage to carryhis passengers to yokohama since he was paid a certain sum per daybut he would have been rash to attempt such a voyage and it was imprudenteven to attempt to reach shanghai  but john bunsby believed in the tankaderewhich rode on the waves like a seagull and perhaps he was not wronglate in the day they passed through the capricious channels of hong kongand the tankadere impelled by favourable winds conducted herself admirablyi do not need pilot said phileas fogg when they got intothe open sea to advise you to use all possible speedtrust me your honour  we are carrying all the sail the wind will let usthe poles would add nothing and are only used when we are going into portits your trade not mine pilot and i confide in youphileas fogg with body erect and legs wide apart standinglike a sailor gazed without staggering at the swelling watersthe young woman who was seated aft was profoundly affectedas she looked out upon the ocean darkening now with the twilighton which she had ventured in so frail a vessel  above her headrustled the white sails which seemed like great white wingsthe boat carried forward by the wind seemed to be flying in the airnight came  the moon was entering her first quarter and herinsufficient light would soon die out in the mist on the horizonclouds were rising from the east and already overcast a partof the heavensthe pilot had hung out his lights which was very necessaryin these seas crowded with vessels bound landward for collisionsare not uncommon occurrences and at the speed she was goingthe least shock would shatter the gallant little craftfix seated in the bow gave himself up to meditation  he kept apartfrom his fellowtravellers knowing mr foggs taciturn tastes besideshe did not quite like to talk to the man whose favours he had acceptedhe was thinking too of the future  it seemed certain that fogg would notstop at yokohama but would at once take the boat for san franciscoand the vast extent of america would ensure him impunity and safetyfoggs plan appeared to him the simplest in the world  instead of sailingdirectly from england to the united states like a common villainhe had traversed three quarters of the globe so as to gain theamerican continent more surely and there after throwingthe police off his track he would quietly enjoy himselfwith the fortune stolen from the bank  but once in the united stateswhat should he fix do  should he abandon this man  no a hundred times nountil he had secured his extradition he would not lose sight of him for an hourit was his duty and he would fulfil it to the end  at all eventsthere was one thing to be thankful for passepartout was not with his masterand it was above all important after the confidences fix had imparted to himthat the servant should never have speech with his masterphileas fogg was also thinking of passepartout who had sostrangely disappeared  looking at the matter from every point of viewit did not seem to him impossible that by some mistake the man mighthave embarked on the carnatic at the last moment and this was alsoaoudas opinion who regretted very much the loss of the worthy fellowto whom she owed so much  they might then find him at yokohamafor if the carnatic was carrying him thither it would be easyto ascertain if he had been on boarda brisk breeze arose about ten oclock but though it mighthave been prudent to take in a reef the pilot after carefullyexamining the heavens let the craft remain rigged as beforethe tankadere bore sail admirably as she drew a great deal of waterand everything was prepared for high speed in case of a galemr fogg and aouda descended into the cabin at midnighthaving been already preceded by fix who had lain down on one of the cotsthe pilot and crew remained on deck all nightat sunrise the next day which was th november the boat had mademore than one hundred miles  the log indicated a mean speed of betweeneight and nine miles  the tankadere still carried all sailand was accomplishing her greatest capacity of speedif the wind held as it was the chances would be in her favourduring the day she kept along the coast where the currents were favourablethe coast irregular in profile and visible sometimes across the clearingswas at most five miles distant  the sea was less boisteroussince the wind came off landa fortunate circumstance for the boatwhich would suffer owing to its small tonnage by a heavy surge on the seathe breeze subsided a little towards noon and set in from the southwestthe pilot put up his poles but took them down again within two hoursas the wind freshened up anewmr fogg and aouda happily unaffected by the roughness of the seaate with a good appetite fix being invited to share their repastwhich he accepted with secret chagrin  to travel at this mansexpense and live upon his provisions was not palatable to himstill he was obliged to eat and so he atewhen the meal was over he took mr fogg apart and saidsirthis sir scorched his lips and he had to control himselfto avoid collaring this gentlemansir you have been very kindto give me a passage on this boat  but though my means will not admitof my expending them as freely as you i must ask to pay my sharelet us not speak of that sir replied mr foggbut if i insistno sir repeated mr fogg in a tone which did not admit of areply  this enters into my general expensesfix as he bowed had a stifled feeling and going forwardwhere he ensconced himself did not open his mouth for the rest of the daymeanwhile they were progressing famously and john bunsby wasin high hope  he several times assured mr fogg that they wouldreach shanghai in time to which that gentleman respondedthat he counted upon it  the crew set to work in good earnestinspired by the reward to be gained  there was not a sheetwhich was not tightened not a sail which was not vigorously hoistednot a lurch could be charged to the man at the helm  they workedas desperately as if they were contesting in a royal yacht regattaby evening the log showed that two hundred and twenty miles had beenaccomplished from hong kong and mr fogg might hope that he would be ableto reach yokohama without recording any delay in his journal in which casethe many misadventures which had overtaken him since he left londonwould not seriously affect his journeythe tankadere entered the straits of fokien which separatethe island of formosa from the chinese coast in the small hoursof the night and crossed the tropic of cancer  the sea was veryrough in the straits full of eddies formed by the countercurrentsand the chopping waves broke her course whilst it became very difficultto stand on deckat daybreak the wind began to blow hard again and the heavensseemed to predict a gale  the barometer announced a speedy changethe mercury rising and falling capriciously the sea alsoin the southeast raised long surges which indicated a tempestthe sun had set the evening before in a red mistin the midst of the phosphorescent scintillations of the oceanjohn bunsby long examined the threatening aspect of the heavensmuttering indistinctly between his teeth  at last he said in a low voiceto mr fogg shall i speak out to your honourof coursewell we are going to have a squallis the wind north or south asked mr fogg quietlysouth  look a typhoon is coming upglad its a typhoon from the south for it will carry us forwardoh if you take it that way said john bunsby ive nothing more to sayjohn bunsbys suspicions were confirmed  at a less advanced season of the yearthe typhoon according to a famous meteorologist would have passed awaylike a luminous cascade of electric flame but in the winter equinoxit was to be feared that it would burst upon them with great violencethe pilot took his precautions in advance  he reefed all sailthe polemasts were dispensed with all hands went forward to the bowsa single triangular sail of strong canvas was hoisted as a stormjibso as to hold the wind from behind  then they waitedjohn bunsby had requested his passengers to go below but thisimprisonment in so narrow a space with little air and the boatbouncing in the gale was far from pleasant  neither mr foggfix nor aouda consented to leave the deckthe storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight oclockwith but its bit of sail the tankadere was lifted like a feather by a windan idea of whose violence can scarcely be given  to compare her speedto four times that of a locomotive going on full steam would be belowthe truththe boat scudded thus northward during the whole day borne onby monstrous waves preserving always fortunately a speed equalto theirs  twenty times she seemed almost to be submerged bythese mountains of water which rose behind her but the adroitmanagement of the pilot saved her  the passengers were oftenbathed in spray but they submitted to it philosophicallyfix cursed it no doubt but aouda with her eyes fastened uponher protector whose coolness amazed her showed herself worthyof him and bravely weathered the storm  as for phileas foggit seemed just as if the typhoon were a part of his programmeup to this time the tankadere had always held her course to the northbut towards evening the wind veering three quarters bore down fromthe northwest  the boat now lying in the trough of the wavesshook and rolled terribly the sea struck her with fearful violenceat night the tempest increased in violence  john bunsby saw the approachof darkness and the rising of the storm with dark misgivingshe thought awhile and then asked his crew if it was not time to slacken speedafter a consultation he approached mr fogg and said i think your honourthat we should do well to make for one of the ports on the coasti think so tooah said the pilot  but which onei know of but one returned mr fogg tranquillyand that isshanghaithe pilot at first did not seem to comprehend he couldscarcely realise so much determination and tenacitythen he cried wellyes  your honour is right  to shanghaiso the tankadere kept steadily on her northward trackthe night was really terrible it would be a miracle if thecraft did not founder  twice it could have been all over with herif the crew had not been constantly on the watch  aouda was exhaustedbut did not utter a complaint  more than once mr fogg rushedto protect her from the violence of the wavesday reappeared  the tempest still raged with undiminished furybut the wind now returned to the southeast  it was a favourable changeand the tankadere again bounded forward on this mountainous seathough the waves crossed each other and imparted shocks and countershockswhich would have crushed a craft less solidly built  from time to timethe coast was visible through the broken mist but no vessel was in sightthe tankadere was alone upon the seathere were some signs of a calm at noon and these became more distinctas the sun descended toward the horizon  the tempest had been as briefas terrific  the passengers thoroughly exhausted could now eat a littleand take some reposethe night was comparatively quiet  some of the sails were again hoistedand the speed of the boat was very good  the next morning at dawnthey espied the coast and john bunsby was able to assert that they werenot one hundred miles from shanghai  a hundred miles and only one dayto traverse them  that very evening mr fogg was due at shanghaiif he did not wish to miss the steamer to yokohama  had there been no stormduring which several hours were lost they would be at this moment withinthirty miles of their destinationthe wind grew decidedly calmer and happily the sea fell with itall sails were now hoisted and at noon the tankadere was withinfortyfive miles of shanghai  there remained yet six hoursin which to accomplish that distance  all on board fearedthat it could not be done and every onephileas fogg no doubtexceptedfelt his heart beat with impatience  the boat must keep upan average of nine miles an hour and the wind was becoming calmerevery moment  it was a capricious breeze coming from the coastand after it passed the sea became smooth  still the tankaderewas so light and her fine sails caught the fickle zephyrs so wellthat with the aid of the currents john bunsby found himself at six oclocknot more than ten miles from the mouth of shanghai river  shanghai itselfis situated at least twelve miles up the stream  at seven they were stillthree miles from shanghai  the pilot swore an angry oath the reward oftwo hundred pounds was evidently on the point of escaping him  he lookedat mr fogg  mr fogg was perfectly tranquil and yet his whole fortunewas at this moment at stakeat this moment also a long black funnel crowned with wreaths of smokeappeared on the edge of the waters  it was the american steamerleaving for yokohama at the appointed timeconfound her cried john bunsby pushing back the rudderwith a desperate jerksignal her said phileas fogg quietlya small brass cannon stood on the forward deck of the tankaderefor making signals in the fogs  it was loaded to the muzzlebut just as the pilot was about to apply a redhot coal to the touchholemr fogg said hoist your flagthe flag was run up at halfmast and this being the signal of distressit was hoped that the american steamer perceiving it would change hercourse a little so as to succour the pilotboatfire said mr fogg  and the booming of the little cannonresounded in the airchapter xxiiin which passepartout finds out that even at the antipodesit is convenient to have some money in ones pocketthe carnatic setting sail from hong kong at halfpast six on theth of november directed her course at full steam towards japanshe carried a large cargo and a wellfilled cabin of passengerstwo staterooms in the rear were however unoccupiedthose whichhad been engaged by phileas foggthe next day a passenger with a halfstupefied eye staggering gaitand disordered hair was seen to emerge from the second cabinand to totter to a seat on deckit was passepartout and what had happened to him was as followsshortly after fix left the opium den two waiters had liftedthe unconscious passepartout and had carried him to the bedreserved for the smokers  three hours later pursued evenin his dreams by a fixed idea the poor fellow awokeand struggled against the stupefying influence of the narcoticthe thought of a duty unfulfilled shook off his torporand he hurried from the abode of drunkennessstaggering and holding himself up by keeping against the wallsfalling down and creeping up again and irresistibly impelledby a kind of instinct he kept crying out the carnatic the carnaticthe steamer lay puffing alongside the quay on the point of startingpassepartout had but few steps to go and rushing upon the plankhe crossed it and fell unconscious on the deck just as the carnaticwas moving off  several sailors who were evidently accustomedto this sort of scene carried the poor frenchman down into the second cabinand passepartout did not wake until they were one hundred and fifty milesaway from china  thus he found himself the next morning on the deckof the carnatic and eagerly inhaling the exhilarating seabreezethe pure air sobered him  he began to collect his sense which he founda difficult task but at last he recalled the events of the evening beforefixs revelation and the opiumhouseit is evident said he to himself that i have been abominably drunkwhat will mr fogg say  at least i have not missed the steamerwhich is the most important thingthen as fix occurred to him as for that rascal i hope weare well rid of him and that he has not dared as he proposedto follow us on board the carnatic  a detective on the trackof mr fogg accused of robbing the bank of england  pshawmr fogg is no more a robber than i am a murderershould he divulge fixs real errand to his master  would itdo to tell the part the detective was playing  would it not bebetter to wait until mr fogg reached london again and thenimpart to him that an agent of the metropolitan police had beenfollowing him round the world and have a good laugh over itno doubt at least it was worth considering  the first thing todo was to find mr fogg and apologise for his singular behaviourpassepartout got up and proceeded as well as he could withthe rolling of the steamer to the afterdeck  he saw no onewho resembled either his master or aouda  good  muttered heaouda has not got up yet and mr fogg has probably found somepartners at whisthe descended to the saloon  mr fogg was not therepassepartout had only however to ask the purser the numberof his masters stateroom  the purser replied that hedid not know any passenger by the name of foggi beg your pardon said passepartout persistently  he is a tall gentlemanquiet and not very talkative and has with him a young ladythere is no young lady on board interrupted the purserhere is a list of the passengers you may see for yourselfpassepartout scanned the list but his masters name was not upon itall at once an idea struck himah am i on the carnaticyeson the way to yokohamacertainlypassepartout had for an instant feared that he was on the wrong boatbut though he was really on the carnatic his master was not therehe fell thunderstruck on a seat  he saw it all nowhe remembered that the time of sailing had been changedthat he should have informed his master of that factand that he had not done so  it was his fault thenthat mr fogg and aouda had missed the steameryes but it was still more the fault of the traitor whoin order to separate him from his master and detainthe latter at hong kong had inveigled him into getting drunkhe now saw the detectives trick and at this moment mr foggwas certainly ruined his bet was lost and he himself perhapsarrested and imprisoned  at this thought passepartout tore his hairah if fix ever came within his reach what a settling of accountsthere would beafter his first depression passepartout became calmerand began to study his situation  it was certainly notan enviable one  he found himself on the way to japanand what should he do when he got there  his pocket was emptyhe had not a solitary shilling not so much as a pennyhis passage had fortunately been paid for in advanceand he had five or six days in which to decide upon his future coursehe fell to at meals with an appetite and ate for mr fogg aoudaand himself  he helped himself as generously as if japan were a desertwhere nothing to eat was to be looked forat dawn on the th the carnatic entered the port of yokohamathis is an important port of call in the pacific where all themailsteamers and those carrying travellers between north americachina

before the mikado the spiritual emperorabsorbed his office in his own  the carnatic anchored at the quaynear the customhouse in the midst of a crowd of ships bearingthe flags of all nationspassepartout went timidly ashore on this so curious territoryof the sons of the sun  he had nothing better to do thantaking chance for his guide to wander aimlessly through the streetsof yokohama  he found himself at first in a thoroughly european quarterthe houses having low fronts and being adorned with verandasbeneath which he caught glimpses of neat peristyles  this quarter occupiedwith its streets squares docks and warehouses all the space betweenthe promontory of the treaty and the river  here as at hong kongand calcutta were mixed crowds of all races americans and englishchinamen and dutchmen mostly merchants ready to buy or sell anythingthe frenchman felt himself as much alone among them as if he had droppeddown in the midst of hottentotshe had at least one resource to call on the french and english consulsat yokohama for assistance  but he shrank from telling the storyof his adventures intimately connected as it was with that of his masterand before doing so he determined to exhaust all other means of aidas chance did not favour him in the european quarter he penetratedthat inhabited by the native japanese determined if necessaryto push on to yeddothe japanese quarter of yokohama is called benten after thegoddess of the sea who is worshipped on the islands round aboutthere passepartout beheld beautiful fir and cedar groves sacredgates of a singular architecture bridges half hid in the midstof bamboos and reeds temples shaded by immense cedartreesholy retreats where were sheltered buddhist priests and sectariesof confucius and interminable streets where a perfect harvest ofrosetinted and redcheeked children who looked as if they had beencut out of japanese screens and who were playing in the midstof shortlegged poodles and yellowish cats might have been gatheredthe streets were crowded with people  priests were passingin processions beating their dreary tambourines police andcustomhouse officers with pointed hats encrusted with lac andcarrying two sabres hung to their waists soldiers clad in bluecotton with white stripes and bearing guns the mikados guardsenveloped in silken doubles hauberks and coats of mailand numbers of military folk of all ranksfor the militaryprofession is as much respected in japan as it is despisedin chinawent hither and thither in groups and pairspassepartout saw too begging friars longrobed pilgrimsand simple civilians with their warped and jetblack hairbig heads long busts slender legs short stature and complexionsvarying from coppercolour to a dead white but never yellowlike the chinese from whom the japanese widely differhe did not fail to observe the curious equipagescarriages and palanquinsbarrows supplied with sails and litters made of bamboo nor the womenwhom he thought not especially handsomewho took little steps with theirlittle feet whereon they wore canvas shoes straw sandals and clogsof worked wood and who displayed tightlooking eyes flat cheststeeth fashionably blackened and gowns crossed with silken scarfstied in an enormous knot behind an ornament which the modernparisian ladies seem to have borrowed from the dames of japanpassepartout wandered for several hours in the midst of this motley crowdlooking in at the windows of the rich and curious shops the jewelleryestablishments glittering with quaint japanese ornaments the restaurantsdecked with streamers and banners the teahouses where the odorous beveragewas being drunk with saki a liquor concocted from the fermentation of riceand the comfortable smokinghouses where they were puffing not opiumwhich is almost unknown in japan but a very fine stringy tobaccohe went on till he found himself in the fields in the midst of vastrice plantations  there he saw dazzling camellias expanding themselveswith flowers which were giving forth their last colours and perfumesnot on bushes but on trees and within bamboo enclosures cherry plumand apple trees which the japanese cultivate rather for their blossomsthan their fruit and which queerlyfashioned grinning scarecrowsprotected from the sparrows pigeons ravens and other voracious birdson the branches of the cedars were perched large eagles amid the foliageof the weeping willows were herons solemnly standing on one legand on every hand were crows ducks hawks wild birds and amultitude of cranes which the japanese consider sacredand which to their minds symbolise long life and prosperityas he was strolling along passepartout espied some violets among the shrubsgood said he ill have some supperbut on smelling them he found that they were odourlessno chance there thought hethe worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat ashearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the carnaticbut as he had been walking about all day the demands of hungerwere becoming importunate  he observed that the butchers stallscontained neither mutton goat nor pork and knowing also thatit is a sacrilege to kill cattle which are preserved solely for farminghe made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in yokohamanor was he mistaken and in default of butchers meathe could have wished for a quarter of wild boar or deera partridge or some quails some game or fish which with ricethe japanese eat almost exclusively  but he found it necessaryto keep up a stout heart and to postpone the meal he craved tillthe following morning  night came and passepartout reenteredthe native quarter where he wandered through the streetslit by varicoloured lanterns looking on at the dancerswho were executing skilful steps and boundings and the astrologerswho stood in the open air with their telescopes  then he cameto the harbour which was lit up by the resin torches of the fishermenwho were fishing from their boatsthe streets at last became quiet and the patrol the officersof which in their splendid costumes and surrounded by their suitespassepartout thought seemed like ambassadors succeeded the bustling crowdeach time a company passed passepartout chuckled and said to himselfgood another japanese embassy departing for europechapter xxiiiin which passepartouts nose becomes outrageously longthe next morning poor jaded famished passepartout said tohimself that he must get something to eat at all hazards and thesooner he did so the better  he might indeed sell his watchbut he would have starved first  now or never he must use thestrong if not melodious voice which nature had bestowed upon himhe knew several french and english songs and resolved to try themupon the japanese who must be lovers of music since they werefor ever pounding on their cymbals tamtams and tambourines andcould not but appreciate european talentit was perhaps rather early in the morning to get up aconcert and the audience prematurely aroused from their slumbersmight not possibly pay their entertainer with coin bearing themikados features  passepartout therefore decided to wait severalhours and as he was sauntering along it occurred to him that hewould seem rather too well dressed for a wandering artist  theidea struck him to change his garments for clothes more in harmonywith his project by which he might also get a little money tosatisfy the immediate cravings of hunger  the resolution takenit remained to carry it outit was only after a long search that passepartout discovered anative dealer in old clothes to whom he applied for an exchangethe man liked the european costume and ere long passepartoutissued from his shop accoutred in an old japanese coat and a sortof onesided turban faded with long use  a few small pieces of silvermoreover jingled in his pocketgood thought he  i will imagine i am at the carnivalhis first care after being thus japanesed was to enter a teahouseof modest appearance and upon half a bird and a little riceto breakfast like a man for whom dinner was as yet a problem to be solvednow thought he when he had eaten heartily i mustnt lose my headi cant sell this costume again for one still more japanese  i mustconsider how to leave this country of the sun of which i shall not retainthe most delightful of memories as quickly as possibleit occurred to him to visit the steamers which were about toleave for america  he would offer himself as a cook or servantin payment of his passage and meals  once at san franciscohe would find some means of going on  the difficulty washow to traverse the four thousand seven hundred milesof the pacific which lay between japan and the new worldpassepartout was not the man to let an idea go beggingand directed his steps towards the docks  but as he approachedthem his project which at first had seemed so simple began to growmore and more formidable to his mind  what need would they haveof a cook or servant on an american steamer and what confidence wouldthey put in him dressed as he was  what references could he giveas he was reflecting in this wise his eyes fell upon an immenseplacard which a sort of clown was carrying through the streetsthis placard which was in english read as follows          acrobatic japanese troupe   honourable william batulcar proprietor           last representationsprior to their departure to the united states                  of the        long noses   long nosesunder the direct patronage of the god tingou           great attractionthe united states said passepartout thats just what i wanthe followed the clown and soon found himself once morein the japanese quarter  a quarter of an hour laterhe stopped before a large cabin adorned with severalclusters of streamers the exterior walls of whichwere designed to represent in violent coloursand without perspective a company of jugglersthis was the honourable william batulcars establishmentthat gentleman was a sort of barnum the director of a troupeof mountebanks jugglers clowns acrobats equilibristsand gymnasts who according to the placard was givinghis last performances before leaving the empire of the sunfor the states of the unionpassepartout entered and asked for mr batulcar who straightwayappeared in personwhat do you want said he to passepartout whom he at firsttook for a nativewould you like a servant sir asked passepartouta servant cried mr batulcar caressing the thick grey beardwhich hung from his chin  i already have two who are obedientand faithful have never left me and serve me for their nourishmentand here they are added he holding out his two robust armsfurrowed with veins as large as the strings of a bassviolso i can be of no use to younonethe devil  i should so like to cross the pacific with youah said the honourable mr batulcar  you are no more a japanesethan i am a monkey  who are you dressed up in that waya man dresses as he canthats true  you are a frenchman arent youyes a parisian of paristhen you ought to know how to make grimaceswhy replied passepartout a little vexed that his nationalityshould cause this question we frenchmen know how to make grimacesit is true but not any better than the americans dotrue  well if i cant take you as a servant i can as a clownyou see my friend in france they exhibit foreign clownsand in foreign parts french clownsahyou are pretty strong ehespecially after a good mealand you can singyes returned passepartout who had formerly been wontto sing in the streetsbut can you sing standing on your head with a top spinningon your left foot and a sabre balanced on your righthumph  i think so replied passepartout recalling the exercisesof his younger dayswell thats enough said the honourable william batulcarthe engagement was concluded there and thenpassepartout had at last found something to do  he was engagedto act in the celebrated japanese troupe  it was not a very dignifiedposition but within a week he would be on his way to san franciscothe performance so noisily announced by the honourable mr batulcarwas to commence at three oclock and soon the deafening instrumentsof a japanese orchestra resounded at the door  passepartoutthough he had not been able to study or rehearse a partwas designated to lend the aid of his sturdy shouldersin the great exhibition of the human pyramid executedby the long noses of the god tingou  this great attractionwas to close the performancebefore three oclock the large shed was invaded by the spectatorscomprising europeans and natives chinese and japanese men womenand children who precipitated themselves upon the narrow benchesand into the boxes opposite the stage  the musicians took up a positioninside and were vigorously performing on their gongs tamtams flutesbones tambourines and immense drumsthe performance was much like all acrobatic displays but it must beconfessed that the japanese are the first equilibrists in the worldone with a fan and some bits of paper performed the gracefultrick of the butterflies and the flowers another traced in the airwith the odorous smoke of his pipe a series of blue wordswhich composed a compliment to the audience while a third juggledwith some lighted candles which he extinguished successivelyas they passed his lips and relit again without interruptingfor an instant his juggling  another reproduced the most singularcombinations with a spinningtop in his hands the revolving topsseemed to be animated with a life of their own in theirinterminable whirling they ran over pipestems the edges of sabreswires and even hairs stretched across the stage they turned aroundon the edges of large glasses crossed bamboo ladders dispersed intoall the corners and produced strange musical effects by the combinationof their various pitches of tone  the jugglers tossed them in the airthrew them like shuttlecocks with wooden battledores and yet they kepton spinning they put them into their pockets and took them outstill whirling as beforeit is useless to describe the astonishing performances of the acrobatsand gymnasts  the turning on ladders poles balls barrels cwas executed with wonderful precisionbut the principal attraction was the exhibition of the long nosesa show to which europe is as yet a strangerthe long noses form a peculiar company under the direct patronageof the god tingou  attired after the fashion of the middle agesthey bore upon their shoulders a splendid pair of wingsbut what especially distinguished them was the long noseswhich were fastened to their faces and the uses which they made of themthese noses were made of bamboo and were five six and even ten feet longsome straight others curved some ribboned and some having imitation wartsupon them  it was upon these appendages fixed tightly on their real nosesthat they performed their gymnastic exercises  a dozen of these sectariesof tingou lay flat upon their backs while others dressed to representlightningrods came and frolicked on their noses jumping from one to anotherand performing the most skilful leapings and somersaultsas a last scene a human pyramid had been announced in whichfifty long noses were to represent the car of juggernautbut instead of forming a pyramid by mounting each others shouldersthe artists were to group themselves on top of the nosesit happened that the performer who had hitherto formed the baseof the car had quitted the troupe and as to fill this partonly strength and adroitness were necessary passepartouthad been chosen to take his placethe poor fellow really felt sad whenmelancholy reminiscenceof his youthhe donned his costume adorned with varicoloured wingsand fastened to his natural feature a false nose six feet longbut he cheered up when he thought that this nose was winninghim something to eathe went upon the stage and took his place beside the restwho were to compose the base of the car of juggernautthey all stretched themselves on the floor their noses pointingto the ceiling  a second group of artists disposed themselves onthese long appendages then a third above these then a fourthuntil a human monument reaching to the very cornices of the theatresoon arose on top of the noses  this elicited loud applausein the midst of which the orchestra was just striking up a deafening airwhen the pyramid tottered the balance was lost one of the lowernoses vanished from the pyramid and the human monument wasshattered like a castle built of cardsit was passepartouts fault  abandoning his positionclearing the footlights without the aid of his wings andclambering up to the righthand gallery he fell at the feet ofone of the spectators crying ah my master my masteryou heremyselfvery well then let us go to the steamer young manmr fogg aouda and passepartout passed through the lobbyof the theatre to the outside where they encounteredthe honourable mr batulcar furious with rage  he demanded damagesfor the breakage of the pyramid and phileas fogg appeased himby giving him a handful of banknotesat halfpast six the very hour of departure mr fogg and aoudafollowed by passepartout who in his hurry had retained his wingsand nose six feet long stepped upon the american steamerchapter xxivduring which mr fogg and party cross the pacific oceanwhat happened when the pilotboat came in sight of shanghai willbe easily guessed  the signals made by the tankadere had beenseen by the captain of the yokohama steamer who espying the flagat halfmast had directed his course towards the little craftphileas fogg after paying the stipulated price of his passage tojohn busby and rewarding that worthy with the additional sum offive hundred and fifty pounds ascended the steamer with aoudaand fix and they started at once for nagasaki and yokohamathey reached their destination on the morning of the th of novemberphileas fogg lost no time in going on board the carnatic where he learnedto aoudas great delightand perhaps to his own though he betrayedno emotionthat passepartout a frenchman had really arrived on herthe day beforethe san francisco steamer was announced to leave that very eveningand it became necessary to find passepartout if possible without delaymr fogg applied in vain to the french and english consuls andafter wandering through the streets a long time began to despairof finding his missing servant  chance or perhaps a kind of presentimentat last led him into the honourable mr batulcars theatre  he certainlywould not have recognised passepartout in the eccentric mountebanks costumebut the latter lying on his back perceived his master in the galleryhe could not help starting which so changed the position of his noseas to bring the pyramid pellmell upon the stageall this passepartout learned from aouda who recounted to himwhat had taken place on the voyage from hong kong to shanghaion the tankadere in company with one mr fixpassepartout did not change countenance on hearing this namehe thought that the time had not yet arrived to divulge to hismaster what had taken place between the detective and himselfand in the account he gave of his absence he simply excused himselffor having been overtaken by drunkenness in smoking opiumat a tavern in hong kongmr fogg heard this narrative coldly without a word and thenfurnished his man with funds necessary to obtain clothing morein harmony with his position  within an hour the frenchman hadcut off his nose and parted with his wings and retained nothingabout him which recalled the sectary of the god tingouthe steamer which was about to depart from yokohama to san franciscobelonged to the pacific mail steamship company and was namedthe general grant  she was a large paddlewheel steamerof two thousand five hundred tons well equipped and very fastthe massive walkingbeam rose and fell above the deckat one end a pistonrod worked up and down and at the otherwas a connectingrod which in changing the rectilinear motionto a circular one was directly connected with the shaft of the paddlesthe general grant was rigged with three masts giving a large capacityfor sails and thus materially aiding the steam power  by makingtwelve miles an hour she would cross the ocean in twentyone daysphileas fogg was therefore justified in hoping that he would reachsan francisco by the nd of december new york by the thand london on the ththus gaining several hours on the fatal dateof the st of decemberthere was a full complement of passengers on board among them englishmany americans a large number of coolies on their way to californiaand several east indian officers who were spending their vacationin making the tour of the world  nothing of moment happened on the voyagethe steamer sustained on its large paddles rolled but littleand the pacific almost justified its name  mr fogg was as calmand taciturn as ever  his young companion felt herself more and moreattached to him by other ties than gratitude his silent but generous natureimpressed her more than she thought and it was almost unconsciously thatshe yielded to emotions which did not seem to have the least effect uponher protector  aouda took the keenest interest in his plans and becameimpatient at any incident which seemed likely to retard his journeyshe often chatted with passepartout who did not fail to perceivethe state of the ladys heart and being the most faithful of domesticshe never exhausted his eulogies of phileas foggs honesty generosityand devotion  he took pains to calm aoudas doubts of a successfultermination of the journey telling her that the most difficult partof it had passed that now they were beyond the fantastic countriesof japan and china and were fairly on their way to civilised places againa railway train from san francisco to new york and a transatlantic steamerfrom new york to liverpool would doubtless bring them to the end of thisimpossible journey round the world within the period agreed uponon the ninth day after leaving yokohama phileas fogg had traversed exactlyone half of the terrestrial globe  the general grant passed on the rdof november the one hundred and eightieth meridian and was at the veryantipodes of london  mr fogg had it is true exhausted fiftytwoof the eighty days in which he was to complete the tour and there wereonly twentyeight left  but though he was only halfway by thedifference of meridians he had really gone over twothirds of thewhole journey for he had been obliged to make long circuits fromlondon to aden from aden to bombay from calcutta to singaporeand from singapore to yokohama  could he have followed withoutdeviation the fiftieth parallel which is that of londonthe whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand mileswhereas he would be forced by the irregular methods of locomotionto traverse twentysix thousand of which he had on the rd of novemberaccomplished seventeen thousand five hundred  and now the course wasa straight one and fix was no longer there to put obstacles in their wayit happened also on the rd of november that passepartoutmade a joyful discovery  it will be remembered that the obstinatefellow had insisted on keeping his famous family watch at london timeand on regarding that of the countries he had passed through as quite falseand unreliable  now on this day though he had not changed the handshe found that his watch exactly agreed with the ships chronometershis triumph was hilarious  he would have liked to know what fixwould say if he were aboardthe rogue told me a lot of stories repeated passepartoutabout the meridians the sun and the moon  moon indeedmoonshine more likely  if one listened to that sort of peoplea pretty sort of time one would keep  i was sure that the sunwould some day regulate itself by my watchpassepartout was ignorant that if the face of his watch hadbeen divided into twentyfour hours like the italian clockshe would have no reason for exultation for the hands of his watchwould then instead of as now indicating nine oclock in the morningindicate nine oclock in the evening that is the twentyfirst hourafter midnight precisely the difference between london time and thatof the one hundred and eightieth meridian  but if fix had been ableto explain this purely physical effect passepartout would not have admittedeven if he had comprehended it  moreover if the detective had been on boardat that moment passepartout would have joined issue with him on a quitedifferent subject and in an entirely different mannerwhere was fix at that momenthe was actually on board the general granton reaching yokohama the detective leaving mr fogg whom he expectedto meet again during the day had repaired at once to the english consulatewhere he at last found the warrant of arrest  it had followed him from bombayand had come by the carnatic on which steamer he himself was supposed to befixs disappointment may be imagined when he reflected that the warrant wasnow useless  mr fogg had left english ground and it was now necessaryto procure his extraditionwell thought fix after a moment of anger my warrant is not good herebut it will be in england  the rogue evidently intends to return to hisown country thinking he has thrown the police off his track  goodi will follow him across the atlantic  as for the money heaven grantthere may be some left  but the fellow has already spent in travellingrewards trials bail elephants and all sorts of charges more thanfive thousand pounds  yet after all the bank is richhis course decided on he went on board the general grantand was there when mr fogg and aouda arrived  to his utteramazement he recognised passepartout despite his theatrical disguisehe quickly concealed himself in his cabin to avoid an awkward explanationand hopedthanks to the number of passengersto remain unperceivedby mr foggs servanton that very day however he met passepartout face to faceon the forward deck  the latter without a wordmade a rush for him grasped him by the throatand much to the amusement of a group of americanswho immediately began to bet on him administeredto the detective a perfect volley of blowswhich proved the great superiority of frenchover english pugilistic skillwhen passepartout had finished he found himself relievedand comforted  fix got up in a somewhat rumpled conditionand looking at his adversary coldly said have you donefor this timeyesthen let me have a word with youbut iin your masters interestspassepartout seemed to be vanquished by fixs coolness for he quietlyfollowed him and they sat down aside from the rest of the passengersyou have given me a thrashing said fix  good i expected itnow listen to me  up to this time i have been mr foggs adversaryi am now in his gameaha cried passepartout you are convinced he is an honest manno replied fix coldly i think him a rascal  sh dont budgeand let me speak  as long as mr fogg was on english groundit was for my interest to detain him there until my warrantof arrest arrived  i did everything i could to keep him backi sent the bombay priests after him i got you intoxicated at hong kongi separated you from him and i made him miss the yokohama steamerpassepartout listened with closed fistsnow resumed fix mr fogg seems to be going back to englandwell i will follow him there  but hereafter i will do as muchto keep obstacles out of his way as i have done up to this timeto put them in his path  ive changed my game you seeand simply because it was for my interest to change ityour interest is the same as mine for it is only in englandthat you will ascertain whether you are in the service of a criminalor an honest manpassepartout listened very attentively to fixand was convinced that he spoke with entire good faithare we friends asked the detectivefriendsno replied passepartout but allies perhapsat the least sign of treason however ill twist your neck for youagreed said the detective quietlyeleven days later on the rd of december the general grantentered the bay of the golden gate and reached san franciscomr fogg had neither gained nor lost a single daychapter xxvin which a slight glimpse is had of san franciscoit was seven in the morning when mr fogg aouda and passepartoutset foot upon the american continent if this name can be given tothe floating quay upon which they disembarked  these quaysrising and falling with the tide thus facilitate the loadingand unloading of vessels  alongside them were clippers of all sizessteamers of all nationalities and the steamboats with several decksrising one above the other which ply on the sacramento and its tributariesthere were also heaped up the products of a commerce which extends to mexicochili peru brazil europe asia and all the pacific islandspassepartout in his joy on reaching at last the american continentthought he would manifest it by executing a perilous vault in fine stylebut tumbling upon some wormeaten planks he fell through themput out of countenance by the manner in which he thus set footupon the new world he uttered a loud cry which so frightenedthe innumerable cormorants and pelicans that are always perchedupon these movable quays that they flew noisily awaymr fogg on reaching shore proceeded to find out at what hour the firsttrain left for new york and learned that this was at six oclock pmhe had therefore an entire day to spend in the californian capitaltaking a carriage at a charge of three dollars he and aouda entered itwhile passepartout mounted the box beside the driver and they set outfor the international hotelfrom his exalted position passepartout observed with much curiositythe wide streets the low evenly ranged houses the anglosaxongothic churches the great docks the palatial wooden and brick warehousesthe numerous conveyances omnibuses horsecars and upon the sidewalksnot only americans and europeans but chinese and indians  passepartoutwas surprised at all he saw  san francisco was no longer the legendary cityof a city of banditti assassins and incendiaries who had flockedhither in crowds in pursuit of plunder a paradise of outlaws where theygambled with golddust a revolver in one hand and a bowieknife in the otherit was now a great commercial emporiumthe lofty tower of its city hall overlooked the whole panoramaof the streets and avenues which cut each other at rightanglesand in the midst of which appeared pleasant verdant squareswhile beyond appeared the chinese quarter seemingly importedfrom the celestial empire in a toybox  sombreros and red shirtsand plumed indians were rarely to be seen but there were silk hatsand black coats everywhere worn by a multitude of nervously activegentlemanlylooking men  some of the streets especially montgomery streetwhich is to san francisco what regent street is to londonthe boulevard des italiens to paris and broadway to new yorkwere lined with splendid and spacious stores which exposedin their windows the products of the entire worldwhen passepartout reached the international hotelit did not seem to him as if he had left england at allthe ground floor of the hotel was occupied by a large bara sort of restaurant freely open to all passersby who mightpartake of dried beef oyster soup biscuits and cheesewithout taking out their purses  payment was made only for the aleporter or sherry which was drunk  this seemed very americanto passepartout  the hotel refreshmentrooms were comfortableand mr fogg and aouda installing themselves at a tablewere abundantly served on diminutive plates by negroes of darkest hueafter breakfast mr fogg accompanied by aouda started forthe english consulate to have his passport visaed  as he wasgoing out he met passepartout who asked him if it would not be wellbefore taking the train to purchase some dozens of enfield riflesand colts revolvers  he had been listening to stories of attacksupon the trains by the sioux and pawnees  mr fogg thought ita useless precaution but told him to do as he thought bestand went on to the consulatehe had not proceeded two hundred steps however when by thegreatest chance in the world he met fix  the detective seemedwholly taken by surprise  what  had mr fogg and himselfcrossed the pacific together and not met on the steamerat least fix felt honoured to behold once more the gentlemanto whom he owed so much and as his business recalled him to europehe should be delighted to continue the journey in such pleasant companymr fogg replied that the honour would be his and the detectivewho was determined not to lose sight of himbegged permissionto accompany them in their walk about san franciscoa requestwhich mr fogg readily grantedthey soon found themselves in montgomery street where a greatcrowd was collected the sidewalks street horsecar railsthe shopdoors the windows of the houses and even the roofswere full of people  men were going about carrying large postersand flags and streamers were floating in the wind while loud crieswere heard on every handhurrah for camerfieldhurrah for mandiboyit was a political meeting at least so fix conjectured who said to mr foggperhaps we had better not mingle with the crowd  there may be danger in ityes returned mr fogg and blows even if they are politicalare still blowsfix smiled at this remark and in order to be able to see withoutbeing jostled about the party took up a position on the top of a flightof steps situated at the upper end of montgomery street  opposite themon the other side of the street between a coal wharf and a petroleum warehousea large platform had been erected in the open air towards which the currentof the crowd seemed to be directedfor what purpose was this meeting  what was the occasion of thisexcited assemblage  phileas fogg could not imagine  was it to nominatesome high officiala governor or member of congress  it was not improbableso agitated was the multitude before themjust at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human massall the hands were raised in the air  some tightly closedseemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the criesan energetic wayno doubt of casting a vote  the crowd swayed back the banners and flagswavered disappeared an instant then reappeared in tattersthe undulations of the human surge reached the stepswhile all the heads floundered on the surface like a seaagitated by a squall  many of the black hats disappearedand the greater part of the crowd seemed to have diminished in heightit is evidently a meeting said fix and its object must bean exciting one  i should not wonder if it were about the alabamadespite the fact that that question is settledperhaps replied mr fogg simplyat least there are two champions in presence of each otherthe honourable mr camerfield and the honourable mr mandiboyaouda leaning upon mr foggs arm observed the tumultuous scenewith surprise while fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all wasbefore the man could reply a fresh agitation arose hurrahs and excitedshouts were heard the staffs of the banners began to be usedas offensive weapons and fists flew about in every directionthumps were exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuseswhich had been blocked up in the crowd  boots and shoes went whirlingthrough the air and mr fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolversmingling in the din the rout approached the stairway and flowed overthe lower step  one of the parties had evidently been repulsedbut the mere lookerson could not tell whether mandiboy or camerfieldhad gained the upper handit would be prudent for us to retire said fix who was anxiousthat mr fogg should not receive any injury at least untilthey got back to london  if there is any question about englandin all this and we were recognised i fear it would go hard with usan english subject began mr fogghe did not finish his sentence for a terrific hubbub now aroseon the terrace behind the flight of steps where they stoodand there were frantic shouts of hurrah for mandiboy  hip hip hurrahit was a band of voters coming to the rescue of their alliesand taking the camerfield forces in flank  mr fogg aoudaand fix found themselves between two fires it was too late to escapethe torrent of men armed with loaded canes and sticks was irresistiblephileas fogg and fix were roughly hustled in their attempts to protecttheir fair companion the former as cool as ever tried to defend himselfwith the weapons which nature has placed at the end of every englishmans armbut in vain  a big brawny fellow with a red beard flushed faceand broad shoulders who seemed to be the chief of the bandraised his clenched fist to strike mr fogg whom he would have givena crushing blow had not fix rushed in and received it in his steadan enormous bruise immediately made its appearance under the detectivessilk hat which was completely smashed inyankee exclaimed mr fogg darting a contemptuous look at the ruffianenglishman returned the other  we will meet againwhen you pleasewhat is your namephileas fogg  and yourscolonel stamp proctorthe human tide now swept by after overturning fix who speedilygot upon his feet again though with tattered clothes  happilyhe was not seriously hurt  his travelling overcoat was dividedinto two unequal parts and his trousers resembled those of certain indianswhich fit less compactly than they are easy to put onaouda had escaped unharmed and fix alone bore marksof the fray in his black and blue bruisethanks said mr fogg to the detectiveas soon as they were out of the crowdno thanks are necessary replied  fix but let us gowhereto a tailorssuch a visit was indeed opportune  the clothing of both mr foggand fix was in rags as if they had themselves been actively engagedin the contest between camerfield and mandiboy  an hour afterthey were once more suitably attired and with aouda returnedto the international hotelpassepartout was waiting for his master armed with half a dozensixbarrelled revolvers  when he perceived fix he knit his browsbut aouda having in a few words told him of their adventurehis countenance resumed its placid expression  fix evidentlywas no longer an enemy but an ally he was faithfully keeping his worddinner over the coach which was to convey the passengers and their luggageto the station drew up to the door  as he was getting in mr foggsaid to fix you have not seen this colonel proctor againnoi will come back to america to find him said phileas fogg calmlyit would not be right for an englishman to permit himself to be treatedin that way without retaliatingthe detective smiled but did not reply  it was clear that mr foggwas one of those englishmen who while they do not tolerate duelling at homefight abroad when their honour is attackedat a quarter before six the travellers reached the stationand found the train ready to depart  as he was about to enter itmr fogg called a porter and said to him my friendwas there not some trouble today in san franciscoit was a political meeting sir replied the porterbut i thought there was a great deal of disturbance in the streetsit was only a meeting assembled for an electionthe election of a generalinchief no doubt asked mr foggno sir of a justice of the peacephileas fogg got into the train which started off at full speedchapter xxviin which phileas fogg and party travel by the pacific railroadfrom ocean to oceanso say the americans and these four wordscompose the general designation of the

seven hundred and eightysix milesbetween omaha and the pacific the railway crosses a territory which is stillinfested by indians and wild beasts and a large tract which the mormonsafter they were driven from illinois in  began to colonisethe journey from new york to san francisco consumed formerlyunder the most favourable conditions at least six monthsit is now accomplished in seven daysit was in  that in spite of the southern members of congresswho wished a more southerly route it was decided to lay the roadbetween the fortyfirst and fortysecond parallels  president lincolnhimself fixed the end of the line at omaha in nebraska  the work wasat once commenced and pursued with true american energy nor did therapidity with which it went on injuriously affect its good executionthe road

milesuch was the road to be traversed in seven days which would enablephileas foggat least so he hopedto take the atlantic steamerat new york on the th for liverpoolthe car which he occupied was a sort of long omnibus on eight wheelsand with no compartments in the interior  it was supplied with two rowsof seats perpendicular to the direction of the train on either sideof an aisle which conducted to the front and rear platformsthese platforms were found throughout the train and the passengerswere able to pass from one end of the train to the otherit was supplied with saloon cars balcony cars restaurantsand smokingcars theatre cars alone were wanting and they willhave these some daybook and news dealers sellers of edibles drinkables and cigarswho seemed to have plenty of customers were continually circulatingin the aislesthe train left oakland station at six oclock  it was already nightcold and cheerless the heavens being overcast with clouds which seemedto threaten snow  the train did not proceed rapidly counting the stoppagesit did not run more than twenty miles an hour which was a sufficient speedhowever to enable it to reach omaha within its designated timethere was but little conversation in the car and soon many of the passengerswere overcome with sleep  passepartout found himself beside the detectivebut he did not talk to him  after recent events their relations with eachother had grown somewhat cold there could no longer be mutual sympathy orintimacy between them  fixs manner had not changed but passepartout was veryreserved and ready to strangle his former friend on the slightest provocationsnow began to fall an hour after they started a fine snow howeverwhich happily could not obstruct the train nothing could be seenfrom the windows but a vast white sheet against which the smokeof the locomotive had a greyish aspectat eight oclock a steward entered the car and announced thatthe time for going to bed had arrived and in a few minutesthe car was transformed into a dormitory  the backs of the seatswere thrown back bedsteads carefully packed were rolled out byan ingenious system berths were suddenly improvised and each travellerhad soon at his disposition a comfortable bed protected from curious eyesby thick curtains  the sheets were clean and the pillows softit only remained to go to bed and sleep which everybody didwhile the train sped on across the state of californiathe country between san francisco and sacramento is not very hillythe central pacific taking sacramento for its startingpointextends eastward to meet the road from omaha  the line from san franciscoto sacramento runs in a northeasterly direction along the american riverwhich empties into san pablo bay  the one hundred and twenty miles betweenthese cities were accomplished in six hours and towards midnight whilefast asleep the travellers passed through sacramento so that they saw nothingof that important place the seat of the state government with its fine quaysits broad streets its noble hotels squares and churchesthe train on leaving sacramento and passing the junction roclin auburnand colfax entered the range of the sierra nevada  cisco was reachedat seven in the morning and an hour later the dormitory was transformedinto an ordinary car and the travellers could observe the picturesquebeauties of the mountain region through which they were steamingthe railway track wound in and out among the passes now approachingthe mountainsides now suspended over precipices avoiding abrupt anglesby bold curves plunging into narrow defiles which seemed to haveno outlet  the locomotive its great funnel emitting a weird lightwith its sharp bell and its cowcatcher extended like a spurmingled its shrieks and bellowings with the noise of torrents and cascadesand twined its smoke among the branches of the gigantic pinesthere were few or no bridges or tunnels on the route  the railwayturned around the sides of the mountains and did not attempt to violatenature by taking the shortest cut from one point to anotherthe train entered the state of nevada through the carson valleyabout nine oclock going always northeasterly and at midday reached renowhere there was a delay of twenty minutes for breakfastfrom this point the road running along humboldt riverpassed northward for several miles by its banks then itturned eastward and kept by the river until it reachedthe humboldt range nearly at the extreme eastern limit of nevadahaving breakfasted mr fogg and his companions resumed their placesin the car and observed the varied landscape which unfolded itselfas they passed along the vast prairies the mountains lining the horizonand the creeks with their frothy foaming streams  sometimes a great herdof buffaloes massing together in the distance seemed like a moveable damthese innumerable multitudes of ruminating beasts often form aninsurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains thousandsof them have been seen passing over the track for hours togetherin compact ranks  the locomotive is then forced to stop and waittill the road is once more clearthis happened indeed to the train in which mr fogg was travellingabout twelve oclock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffaloencumbered the track  the locomotive slackening its speed tried to clearthe way with its cowcatcher but the mass of animals was too greatthe buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait uttering now and thendeafening bellowings  there was no use of interrupting them forhaving taken a particular direction nothing can moderate and changetheir course it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could containthe travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platformsbut phileas fogg who had the most reason of all to be in a hurryremained in his seat and waited philosophically until it should pleasethe buffaloes to get out of the waypassepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned and longedto discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon themwhat a country cried he  mere cattle stop the trains and go byin a procession just as if they were not impeding travel  parbleui should like to know if mr fogg foresaw this mishap in his programmeand heres an engineer who doesnt dare to run the locomotiveinto this herd of beaststhe engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle and he was wisehe would have crushed the first buffaloes no doubt with the cowcatcherbut the locomotive however powerful would soon have been checkedthe train would inevitably have been thrown off the trackand would then have been helplessthe best course was to wait patiently and regain the lost timeby greater speed when the obstacle was removed  the processionof buffaloes lasted three full hours and it was night beforethe track was clear  the last ranks of the herd were now passing overthe rails while the first had already disappeared below the southern horizonit was eight oclock when the train passed through the defilesof the humboldt range and halfpast nine when it penetrated utahthe region of the great salt lake the singular colony of the mormonschapter xxviiin which passepartout undergoes at a speed of twenty miles an houra course of mormon historyduring the night of the th of december the train ran southeasterlyfor about fifty miles then rose an equal distance in a northeasterlydirection towards the great salt lakepassepartout about nine oclock went out upon the platform to take the airthe weather was cold the heavens grey but it was not snowingthe suns disc enlarged by the mist seemed an enormous ring of goldand passepartout was amusing himself by calculating its valuein pounds sterling when he was diverted from this interesting studyby a strangelooking personage who made his appearance on the platformthis personage who had taken the train at elko was tall and darkwith black moustache black stockings a black silk hat a black waistcoatblack trousers a white cravat and dogskin gloves  he might have beentaken for a clergyman  he went from one end of the train to the otherand affixed to the door of each car a notice written in manuscriptpassepartout approached and read one of these notices which stated thatelder william hitch mormon missionary taking advantage of his presenceon train no  would deliver a lecture on mormonism in car no from eleven to twelve oclock and that he invited all who were desirousof being instructed concerning the mysteries of the religion of thelatter day saints to attendill go said passepartout to himself  he knew nothingof mormonism except the custom of polygamy which is its foundationthe news quickly spread through the train which containedabout one hundred passengers thirty of whom at mostattracted by the notice ensconced themselves in car no passepartout took one of the front seats  neither mr foggnor fix cared to attendat the appointed hour elder william hitch rose and in an irritated voiceas if he had already been contradicted said i tell you that joe smithis a martyr that his brother hiram is a martyr and that the persecutionsof the united states government against the prophets will also make a martyrof brigham young  who dares to say the contraryno one ventured to gainsay the missionary whose excited tone contrastedcuriously with his naturally calm visage  no doubt his anger arosefrom the hardships to which the mormons were actually subjectedthe government had just succeeded with some difficulty in reducingthese independent fanatics to its rule  it had made itself master of utahand subjected that territory to the laws of the union after imprisoningbrigham young on a charge of rebellion and polygamy  the disciplesof the prophet had since redoubled their efforts and resistedby words at least the authority of congress  elder hitch as is seenwas trying to make proselytes on the very railway trainsthen emphasising his words with his loud voice and frequent gestureshe related the history of the mormons from biblical times how thatin israel a mormon prophet of the tribe of joseph published the annalsof the new religion and bequeathed them to his son mormonhow many centuries later a translation of this precious bookwhich was written in egyptian was made by joseph smith juniora vermont farmer who revealed himself as a mystical prophet in and how in short the celestial messenger appeared to himin an illuminated forest and gave him the annals of the lordseveral of the audience not being much interested inthe missionarys narrative here left the car but elder hitchcontinuing his lecture related how smith junior with his fathertwo brothers and a few disciples founded the church of thelatter day saints which adopted not only in americabut in england norway and sweden and germany counts many artisansas well as men engaged in the liberal professions among its membershow a colony was established in ohio a temple erected there at acost of two hundred thousand dollars and a town built at kirklandhow smith became an enterprising banker and received from a simple mummyshowman a papyrus scroll written by abraham and several famous egyptiansthe elders story became somewhat wearisome and his audiencegrew gradually less until it was reduced to twenty passengersbut this did not disconcert the enthusiast who proceeded withthe story of joseph smiths bankruptcy in  and how his ruinedcreditors gave him a coat of tar and feathers his reappearancesome years afterwards more honourable and honoured than everat independence missouri the chief of a flourishing colonyof three thousand disciples and his pursuit thence by outraged gentilesand retirement into the far westten hearers only were now left among them honest passepartoutwho was listening with all his ears  thus he learned thatafter long persecutions smith reappeared in illinoisand in  founded a community at nauvoo on the mississippinumbering twentyfive thousand souls of which he became mayorchief justice and generalinchief that he announced himselfin  as a candidate for the presidency of the united statesand that finally being drawn into ambuscade at carthagehe was thrown into prison and assassinated by a band of mendisguised in maskspassepartout was now the only person left in the car and the elderlooking him full in the face reminded him that two years afterthe assassination of joseph smith the inspired prophet brigham younghis successor left nauvoo for the banks of the great salt lake wherein the midst of that fertile region directly on the route of the emigrantswho crossed utah on their way to california the new colony thanks tothe polygamy practised by the mormons had flourished beyond expectationsand this added elder william hitch this is why the jealousy of congresshas been aroused against us  why have the soldiers of the union invadedthe soil of utah  why has brigham young our chief been imprisonedin contempt of all justice  shall we yield to force  neverdriven from vermont driven from illinois driven from ohiodriven from missouri driven from utah we shall yet find someindependent territory on which to plant our tents  and youmy brother continued the elder fixing his angry eyesupon his single auditor will you not plant yours theretoo under the shadow of our flagno replied passepartout courageously in his turn retiringfrom the car and leaving the elder to preach to vacancyduring the lecture the train had been making good progressand towards halfpast twelve it reached the northwest borderof the great salt lake  thence the passengers could observethe vast extent of this interior sea which is also called the dead seaand into which flows an american jordan  it is a picturesque expanseframed in lofty crags in large strata encrusted with white salta superb sheet of water which was formerly of larger extent than nowits shores having encroached with the lapse of time and thus at oncereduced its breadth and increased its depththe salt lake seventy miles long and thirtyfive wideis situated three miles eight hundred feet above the seaquite different from lake asphaltite whose depressionis twelve hundred feet below the sea it contains considerable saltand one quarter of the weight of its water is solid matterits specific weight being  and after being distilled fishes are of course unable to live in it and those which descendthrough the jordan the weber and other streams soon perishthe country around the lake was well cultivated for the mormonsare mostly farmers while ranches and pens for domesticated animalsfields of wheat corn and other cereals luxuriant prairieshedges of wild rose clumps of acacias and milkwortwould have been seen six months later  now the groundwas covered with a thin powdering of snowthe train reached ogden at two oclock where it rested for six hoursmr fogg and his party had time to pay a visit to salt lake cityconnected with ogden by a branch road and they spent two hoursin this strikingly american town built on the pattern of other citiesof the union like a checkerboard with the sombre sadness of rightanglesas victor hugo expresses it  the founder of the city of the saintscould not escape from the taste for symmetry which distinguishesthe anglosaxons  in this strange country where the peopleare certainly not up to the level of their institutionseverything is done squarelycities houses and folliesthe travellers then were promenading at three oclockabout the streets of the town built between the banks of thejordan and the spurs of the wahsatch range  they saw fewor no churches but the prophets mansion the courthouseand the arsenal bluebrick houses with verandas and porchessurrounded by gardens bordered with acacias palms and locustsa clay and pebble wall built in  surrounded the townand in the principal street were the market and several hotelsadorned with pavilions  the place did not seem thickly populatedthe streets were almost deserted except in the vicinity of the templewhich they only reached after having traversed several quarterssurrounded by palisades  there were many women which was easilyaccounted for by the peculiar institution of the mormonsbut it must not be supposed that all the mormons are polygamiststhey are free to marry or not as they please but it is worth notingthat it is mainly the female citizens of utah who are anxious to marryas according to the mormon religion maiden ladies are not admittedto the possession of its highest joys  these poor creatures seemedto be neither well off nor happy  somethe more welltodo no doubtwore short open black silk dresses under a hood or modest shawlothers were habited in indian fashionpassepartout could not behold without a certain fright these womencharged in groups with conferring happiness on a single mormonhis common sense pitied above all the husband  it seemed to hima terrible thing to have to guide so many wives at once acrossthe vicissitudes of life and to conduct them as it werein a body to the mormon paradise with the prospect of seeing themin the company of the glorious smith who doubtless was the chief ornamentof that delightful place to all eternity  he felt decidedly repelledfrom such a vocation and he imaginedperhaps he was mistakenthat the fair ones of salt lake city cast rather alarming glanceson his person  happily his stay there was but brief  at four the partyfound themselves again at the station took their places in the trainand the whistle sounded for starting  just at the moment howeverthat the locomotive wheels began to move cries of stop stop were heardtrains like time and tide stop for no one  the gentlemanwho uttered the cries was evidently a belated mormon  he wasbreathless with running  happily for him the station had neithergates nor barriers  he rushed along the track jumped on the rearplatform of the train and fell exhausted into one of the seatspassepartout who had been anxiously watching this amateur gymnastapproached him with lively interest and learned that he had taken flightafter an unpleasant domestic scenewhen the mormon had recovered his breath passepartout venturedto ask him politely how many wives he had for from the mannerin which he had decamped it might be thought that he had twenty at leastone sir replied the mormon raising his arms heavenwardone and that was enoughchapter xxviiiin which passepartout does not succeed in making anybody listen to reasonthe train on leaving great salt lake at ogden passed northwardfor an hour as far as weber river having completed nearly ninehundred miles from san francisco  from this point it tookan easterly direction towards the jagged wahsatch mountainsit was in the section included between this range and therocky mountains that the american engineers found the mostformidable difficulties in laying the road and that the governmentgranted a subsidy of fortyeight thousand dollars per mileinstead of sixteen thousand allowed for the work done on the plainsbut the engineers instead of violating nature avoided its difficultiesby winding around instead of penetrating the rocks  one tunnel onlyfourteen thousand feet in length was pierced in order to arriveat the great basinthe track up to this time had reached its highest elevation atthe great salt lake  from this point it described a long curvedescending towards bitter creek valley to rise again to thedividing ridge of the waters between the atlantic and the pacificthere were many creeks in this mountainous region and it was necessaryto cross muddy creek green creek and others upon culvertspassepartout grew more and more impatient as they went onwhile fix longed to get out of this difficult region and was moreanxious than phileas fogg himself to be beyond the danger of delaysand accidents and set foot on english soilat ten oclock at night the train stopped at fort bridger stationand twenty minutes later entered wyoming territory following thevalley of bitter creek throughout  the next day th decemberthey stopped for a quarter of an hour at green river stationsnow had fallen abundantly during the night but being mixed with rainit had half melted and did not interrupt their progress  the bad weatherhowever annoyed passepartout for the accumulation of snow by blockingthe wheels of the cars would certainly have been fatal to mr foggs tourwhat an idea he said to himself  why did my master makethis journey in winter  couldnt he have waited for the goodseason to increase his chanceswhile the worthy frenchman was absorbed in the state of the skyand the depression of the temperature aouda was experiencingfears from a totally different causeseveral passengers had got off at green river and were walking up and downthe platforms and among these aouda recognised colonel stamp proctorthe same who had so grossly insulted phileas fogg at the san francisco meetingnot wishing to be recognised the young woman drew back from the windowfeeling much alarm at her discovery  she was attached to the man whohowever coldly gave her daily evidences of the most absolute devotionshe did not comprehend perhaps the depth of the sentiment with whichher protector inspired her which she called gratitude but whichthough she was unconscious of it was really more than thather heart sank within her when she recognised the man whommr fogg desired sooner or later to call to account for his conductchance alone it was clear had brought colonel proctor on this trainbut there he was and it was necessary at all hazards that phileas foggshould not perceive his adversaryaouda seized a moment when mr fogg was asleep to tell fix and passepartoutwhom she had seenthat proctor on this train cried fix  well reassure yourselfmadam before he settles with mr fogg he has got to deal with meit seems to me that i was the more insulted of the twoand besides added passepartout ill take charge of himcolonel as he ismr fix resumed aouda mr fogg will allow no one to avenge himhe said that he would come back to america to find this manshould he perceive colonel proctor we could not prevent a collisionwhich might have terrible results  he must not see himyou are right madam replied fix a meeting between themmight ruin all  whether he were victorious or beaten mr foggwould be delayed andand added passepartout that would play the game of the gentlemenof the reform club  in four days we shall be in new york  wellif my master does not leave this car during those four dayswe may hope that chance will not bring him face to face with thisconfounded american  we must if possible prevent his stirring out of itthe conversation dropped  mr fogg had just woke upand was looking out of the window  soon after passepartoutwithout being heard by his master or aouda whispered to the detectivewould you really fight for himi would do anything replied fix in a tone which betrayed determined willto get him back living to europepassepartout felt something like a shudder shoot through his framebut his confidence in his master remained unbrokenwas there any means of detaining mr fogg in the car to avoid a meetingbetween him and the colonel  it ought not to be a difficult tasksince that gentleman was naturally sedentary and little curiousthe detective at least seemed to have found a way for after a few momentshe said to mr fogg these are long and slow hours sir that we are passingon the railwayyes replied mr fogg but they passyou were in the habit of playing whist resumed fix on the steamersyes but it would be difficult to do so here  i have neither cardsnor partnersoh but we can easily buy some cards for they are soldon all the american trains  and as for partners if madam playscertainly sir aouda quickly replied i understand whistit is part of an english educationi myself have some pretensions to playing a good gamewell here are three of us and a dummyas you please sir replied phileas fogg heartily gladto resume his favourite pastime even on the railwaypassepartout was dispatched in search of the stewardand soon returned with two packs of cards some pinscounters and a shelf covered with cloththe game commenced  aouda understood whist sufficiently welland even received some compliments on her playing from mr foggas for the detective he was simply an adept and worthy of beingmatched against his present opponentnow thought passepartout weve got him  he wont budgeat eleven in the morning the train had reached the dividing ridge of the watersat bridger pass seven thousand five hundred and twentyfour feet abovethe level of the sea one of the highest points attained by the trackin crossing the rocky mountains  after going about two hundred milesthe travellers at last found themselves on one of those vast plainswhich extend to the atlantic and which nature has made so propitiousfor laying the iron roadon the declivity of the atlantic basin the first streamsbranches of the north platte river already appearedthe whole northern and eastern horizon was bounded by the immensesemicircular curtain which is formed by the southern portionof the rocky mountains the highest being laramie peakbetween this and the railway extended vast plainsplentifully irrigated  on the right rose the lower spursof the mountainous mass which extends southward to the sourcesof the arkansas river one of the great tributaries of the missouriat halfpast twelve the travellers caught sight for an instant of fort halleckwhich commands that section and in a few more hours the rocky mountainswere crossed  there was reason to hope then that no accident would markthe journey through this difficult country  the snow had ceased fallingand the air became crisp and cold  large birds frightened by the locomotiverose and flew off in the distance  no wild beast appeared on the plainit was a desert in its vast nakednessafter a comfortable breakfast served in the car mr fogg and his partners hadjust resumed whist when a violent whistling was heard and the train stoppedpassepartout put his head out of the door but saw nothing to cause the delayno station was in viewaouda and fix feared that mr fogg might take it into his head to get outbut that gentleman contented himself with saying to his servantsee what is the matterpassepartout rushed out of the car  thirty or forty passengershad already descended amongst them colonel stamp proctorthe train had stopped before a red signal which blocked the waythe engineer and conductor were talking excitedly with a signalmanwhom the stationmaster at medicine bow the next stopping placehad sent on before  the passengers drew around and took partin the discussion in which colonel proctor with his insolent mannerwas conspicuouspassepartout joining the group heard the signalman sayno you cant pass  the bridge at medicine bow is shakyand would not bear the weight of the trainthis was a suspensionbridge thrown over some rapids about amile from the place where they now were  according to thesignalman it was in a ruinous condition several of the ironwires being broken and it was impossible to risk the passagehe did not in any way exaggerate the condition of the bridgeit may be taken for granted that rash as the americans usually arewhen they are prudent there is good reason for itpassepartout not daring to apprise his master of what he heardlistened with set teeth immovable as a statuehum cried colonel proctor but we are not going to stay herei imagine and take root in the snowcolonel replied the conductor we have telegraphed to omaha for a trainbut it is not likely that it will reach medicine bow is less than six hourssix hours cried passepartoutcertainly returned the conductor besides it will take us as longas that to reach medicine bow on footbut it is only a mile from here said one of the passengersyes but its on the other side of the riverand cant we cross that in a boat asked the colonelthats impossible  the creek is swelled by the rains  it is a rapidand we shall have to make a circuit of ten miles to the north to find a fordthe colonel launched a volley of oaths denouncing the railwaycompany and the conductor and passepartout who was furiouswas not disinclined to make common cause with him  here wasan obstacle indeed which all his masters banknotes could not removethere was a general disappointment among the passengers whowithout reckoning the delay saw themselves compelled to trudgefifteen miles over a plain covered with snow  they grumbled andprotested and would certainly have thus attracted phileas foggsattention if he had not been completely absorbed in his gamepassepartout found that he could not avoid telling his master whathad occurred and with hanging head he was turning towards the carwhen the engineer a true yankee named forster called outgentlemen perhaps there is a way after all to get overon the bridge asked a passengeron the bridgewith our trainwith our trainpassepartout stopped short and eagerly listened to the engineerbut the bridge is unsafe urged the conductorno matter replied forster i think that by putting on thevery highest speed we might have a chance of getting overthe devil muttered passepartoutbut a number of the passengers were at once attracted by theengineers proposal and colonel proctor was especially delightedand found the plan a very feasible one  he told stories aboutengineers leaping their trains over rivers without bridgesby putting on full steam and many of those present avowedthemselves of the engineers mindwe have fifty chances out of a hundred of getting over said oneeighty ninetypassepartout was astounded and though ready to attempt anything to getover medicine creek thought the experiment proposed a little too americanbesides thought he theres a still more simple way and it does not evenoccur to any of these people  sir said he aloud to one of the passengersthe engineers plan seems to me a little dangerous buteighty chances replied the passenger turning his back on himi know it said passepartout turning to another passengerbut a simple ideaideas are no use returned the american shrugging his shouldersas the engineer assures us that we can passdoubtless urged passepartout we can pass but perhaps it wouldbe more prudentwhat  prudent cried colonel proctor whom this word seemedto excite prodigiously  at full speed dont you see at full speedi knowi see repeated passepartout but it would be if not more prudentsince that word displeases you at least more naturalwho  what  whats the matter with this fellow cried severalthe poor fellow did not know to whom to address himselfare you afraid asked colonel proctori afraid  very well i will show these people that a frenchmancan be as american as theyall aboard cried the conductoryes all aboard repeated passepartout and immediatelybut they cant prevent me from thinking that it would be more naturalfor us to cross the bridge on foot and let the train come afterbut no one heard this sage reflection nor would anyone have acknowledgedits justice  the passengers resumed their places in the carspassepartout took his seat without telling what had passedthe whistplayers were quite absorbed in their gamethe locomotive whistled vigorously the engineer reversing the steambacked the train for nearly a mileretiring like a jumper in orderto take a longer leap  then with another whistle he began to move forwardthe train increased its speed and soon its rapidity became frightfula prolonged screech issued from the locomotive the piston worked up and downtwenty strokes to the second  they perceived that the whole train rushingon at the rate of a hundred miles an hour hardly bore upon the rails at alland they

onenot even the dummycomplained of the length of the trip  fix had begun by winning severalguineas which he seemed likely to lose but he showed himself a not lesseager whistplayer than mr fogg  during the morning chance distinctlyfavoured that gentleman  trumps and honours were showered upon his handsonce having resolved on a bold stroke he was on the point of playing a spadewhen a voice behind him said i should play a diamondmr fogg aouda and fix raised their heads and beheld colonel proctorstamp proctor and phileas fogg recognised each other at onceah its you is it englishman cried the colonelits you who are going to play a spadeand who plays it replied phileas fogg coollythrowing down the ten of spadeswell it pleases me to have it diamondsreplied colonel proctor in an insolent tonehe made a movement as if to seize the card which had just been playedadding you dont understand anything about whistperhaps i do as well as another said phileas fogg risingyou have only to try son of john bull replied the colonelaouda turned pale and her blood ran cold  she seized mr foggsarm and gently pulled him back  passepartout was ready to pounceupon the american who was staring insolently at his opponentbut fix got up and going to colonel proctor said you forgetthat it is i with whom you have to deal sir for it was iwhom you not only insulted but struckmr fix said mr fogg pardon me but this affair is mineand mine only  the colonel has again insulted me by insistingthat i should not play a spade and he shall give me satisfaction for itwhen and where you will replied the american and with whateverweapon you chooseaouda in vain attempted to retain mr fogg as vainly did thedetective endeavour to make the quarrel his  passepartout wishedto throw the colonel out of the window but a sign from his masterchecked him  phileas fogg left the car and the american followedhim upon the platform  sir said mr fogg to his adversaryi am in a great hurry to get back to europe and any delay whateverwill be greatly to my disadvantagewell whats that to me replied colonel proctorsir said mr fogg very politely after our meeting at san franciscoi determined to return to america and find you as soon as i had completedthe business which called me to englandreallywill you appoint a meeting for six months hencewhy not ten years hencei say six months returned phileas fogg and i shall beat the place of meeting promptlyall this is an evasion cried stamp proctor  now or neververy good  you are going to new yorknoto chicagonoto omahawhat difference is it to you  do you know plum creekno replied mr foggits the next station  the train will be there in an hourand will stop there ten minutes  in ten minutes severalrevolvershots could be exchangedvery well said mr fogg  i will stop at plum creekand i guess youll stay there too added the american insolentlywho knows replied mr fogg returning to the car as coolly as usualhe began to reassure aouda telling her that blusterers were neverto be feared and begged fix to be his second at the approaching duela request which the detective could not refuse  mr fogg resumedthe interrupted game with perfect calmnessat eleven oclock the locomotives whistle announced that they wereapproaching plum creek station  mr fogg rose and followed by fixwent out upon the platform  passepartout accompanied him carryinga pair of revolvers  aouda remained in the car as pale as deaththe door of the next car opened and colonel proctor appeared on the platformattended by a yankee of his own stamp as his second  but just as thecombatants were about to step from the train the conductor hurried upand shouted you cant get off gentlemenwhy not asked the colonelwe are twenty minutes late and we shall not stopbut i am going to fight a duel with this gentlemani am sorry said the conductor but we shall be off at oncetheres the bell ringing nowthe train startedim really very sorry gentlemen said the conductorunder any other circumstances i should have been happy to oblige youbut after all as you have not had time to fight herewhy not fight as we go alongthat wouldnt be convenient perhaps for this gentlemansaid the colonel in a jeering toneit would be perfectly so replied phileas foggwell we are really in america thought passepartoutand the conductor is a gentleman of the first orderso muttering he followed his masterthe two combatants their seconds and the conductor passed throughthe cars to the rear of the train  the last car was only occupiedby a dozen passengers whom the conductor politely asked if they wouldnot be so kind as to leave it vacant for a few moments as two gentlemenhad an affair of honour to settle  the passengers granted the requestwith alacrity and straightway disappeared on the platformthe car which was some fifty feet long was very convenientfor their purpose  the adversaries might march on each otherin the aisle and fire at their ease  never was duel more easilyarranged  mr fogg and colonel proctor each provided with twosixbarrelled revolvers entered the car  the seconds remainingoutside shut them in  they were to begin firing at the firstwhistle of the locomotive  after an interval of two minuteswhat remained of the two gentlemen would be taken from the carnothing could be more simple  indeed it was all so simplethat fix and passepartout felt their hearts beating as if theywould crack  they were listening for the whistle agreed uponwhen suddenly savage cries resounded in the air accompaniedby reports which certainly did not issue from the car wherethe duellists were  the reports continued in front and the wholelength of the train  cries of terror proceeded from the interiorof the carscolonel proctor and mr fogg revolvers in hand hastily quittedtheir prison and rushed forward where the noise was most clamorousthey then perceived that the train was attacked by a band of siouxthis was not the first attempt of these daring indians for more thanonce they had waylaid trains on the road  a hundred of them hadaccording to their habit jumped upon the steps without stoppingthe train with the ease of a clown mounting a horse at full gallopthe sioux were armed with guns from which came the reportsto which the passengers who were almost all armed respondedby revolvershotsthe indians had first mounted the engine and half stunnedthe engineer and stoker with blows from their musketsa sioux chief wishing to stop the train but not knowinghow to work the regulator had opened wide instead of closingthe steamvalve and the locomotive was plunging forwardwith terrific velocitythe sioux had at the same time invaded the cars skipping likeenraged monkeys over the roofs thrusting open the doorsand fighting hand to hand with the passengers  penetrating thebaggagecar they pillaged it throwing the trunks out of the trainthe cries and shots were constant  the travellers defendedthemselves bravely some of the cars were barricadedand sustained a siege like moving forts carried alongat a speed of a hundred miles an houraouda behaved courageously from the first  she defended herselflike a true heroine with a revolver which she shot through the brokenwindows whenever a savage made his appearance  twenty sioux had fallenmortally wounded to the ground and the wheels crushed those who fellupon the rails as if they had been worms  several passengersshot or stunned lay on the seatsit was necessary to put an end to the struggle which had lastedfor ten minutes and which would result in the triumph of the siouxif the train was not stopped  fort kearney station where there wasa garrison was only two miles distant but that once passedthe sioux would be masters of the train between fort kearneyand the station beyondthe conductor was fighting beside mr fogg when he was shot and fellat the same moment he cried unless the train is stopped in five minuteswe are lostit shall be stopped said phileas fogg preparing to rush from the carstay monsieur cried passepartout i will gomr fogg had not time to stop the brave fellow who opening a doorunperceived by the indians succeeded in slipping under the carand while the struggle continued and the balls whizzed across eachother over his head he made use of his old acrobatic experienceand with amazing agility worked his way under the cars holding onto the chains aiding himself by the brakes and edges of the sashescreeping from one car to another with marvellous skilland thus gaining the forward end of the trainthere suspended by one hand between the baggagecar and the tenderwith the other he loosened the safety chains but owing to the tractionhe would never have succeeded in unscrewing the yokingbarhad not a violent concussion jolted this bar out  the trainnow detached from the engine remained a little behindwhilst the locomotive rushed forward with increased speedcarried on by the force already acquired the train still movedfor several minutes but the brakes were worked and at last they stoppedless than a hundred feet from kearney stationthe soldiers of the fort attracted by the shots hurried upthe sioux had not expected them and decamped in a body beforethe train entirely stoppedbut when the passengers counted each other on the station platformseveral were found missing among others the courageous frenchmanwhose devotion had just saved themchapter xxxin which phileas fogg simply does his dutythree passengers including passepartout had disappeared  had they beenkilled in the struggle  were they taken prisoners by the siouxit was impossible to tellthere were many wounded but none mortally  colonel proctor was oneof the most seriously hurt he had fought bravely and a ball had enteredhis groin  he was carried into the station with the other wounded passengersto receive such attention as could be of availaouda was safe and phileas fogg who had been in the thickestof the fight had not received a scratch  fix was slightlywounded in the arm  but passepartout was not to be foundand tears coursed down aoudas cheeksall the passengers had got out of the train the wheelsof which were stained with blood  from the tyres and spokeshung ragged pieces of flesh  as far as the eye could reachon the white plain behind red trails were visible  the last siouxwere disappearing in the south along the banks of republican rivermr fogg with folded arms remained motionless  he had a seriousdecision to make  aouda standing near him looked at him without speakingand he understood her look  if his servant was a prisoner ought he notto risk everything to rescue him from the indians  i will find himliving or dead said he quietly to aoudaah mrmr fogg cried she clasping his handsand covering them with tearsliving added mr fogg if we do not lose a momentphileas fogg by this resolution inevitably sacrificed himselfhe pronounced his own doom  the delay of a single day would makehim lose the steamer at new york and his bet would be certainly lostbut as he thought it is my duty he did not hesitatethe commanding officer of fort kearney was there  a hundredof his soldiers had placed themselves in a position to defendthe station should the sioux attack itsir said mr fogg to the captain three passengers have disappeareddead asked the captaindead or prisoners that is the uncertainty which must be solveddo you propose to pursue the siouxthats a serious thing to do sir returned the captainthese indians may retreat beyond the arkansas and i cannotleave the fort unprotectedthe lives of three men are in question sir said phileas foggdoubtless but can i risk the lives of fifty men to save threei dont know whether you can sir but you ought to do sonobody here returned the other has a right to teach me my dutyvery well said mr fogg coldly  i will go aloneyou sir cried fix coming up you go alone in pursuit of the indianswould you have me leave this poor fellow to perishhim to whom every one present owes his life  i shall gono sir you shall not go alone cried the captaintouched in spite of himself  no you are a brave manthirty volunteers he added turning to the soldiersthe whole company started forward at once  the captain hadonly to pick his men  thirty were chosen and an old sergeantplaced at their headthanks captain said mr foggwill you let me go with you asked fixdo as you please sir  but if you wish to do me a favouryou will remain with aouda  in case anything should happen to mea sudden pallor overspread the detectives face  separate himselffrom the man whom he had so persistently followed step by stepleave him to wander about in this desert  fix gazed attentivelyat mr fogg and despite his suspicions and of the strugglewhich was going on within him he lowered his eyes before that calmand frank looki will stay said hea few moments after mr fogg pressed the young womans hand andhaving confided to her his precious carpetbag went off with the sergeantand his little squad  but before going he had said to the soldiersmy friends i will divide five thousand dollars among you if we savethe prisonersit was then a little past noonaouda retired to a waitingroom and there she waited alonethinking of the simple and noble generosity the tranquil courageof phileas fogg  he had sacrificed his fortune and was nowrisking his life all without hesitation from duty in silencefix did not have the same thoughts and could scarcely concealhis agitation  he walked feverishly up and down the platformbut soon resumed his outward composure  he now saw the folly of whichhe had been guilty in letting fogg go alone  what  this manwhom he had just followed around the world was permitted now toseparate himself from him  he began to accuse and abuse himselfand as if he were director of police administered to himselfa sound lecture for his greennessi have been an idiot he thought and this man will see ithe has gone and wont come back  but how is it that i fixwho have in my pocket a warrant for his arrest have beenso fascinated by him  decidedly i am nothing but an assso reasoned the detective while the hours crept by all too slowlyhe did not know what to do  sometimes he was tempted to tell aouda allbut he could not doubt how the young woman would receive his confidenceswhat course should he take  he thought of pursuing fogg acrossthe vast white plains it did not seem impossible that he might overtake himfootsteps were easily printed on the snow  but soon under a new sheetevery imprint would be effacedfix became discouraged  he felt a sort of insurmountable longingto abandon the game altogether  he could now leave fort kearney stationand pursue his journey homeward in peacetowards two oclock in the afternoon while it was snowing hardlong whistles were heard approaching from the east  a great shadowpreceded by a wild light slowly advanced appearing still largerthrough the mist which gave it a fantastic aspect  no trainwas expected from the east neither had there been time for the succourasked for by telegraph to arrive the train from omaha to san franciscowas not due till the next day  the mystery was soon explainedthe locomotive which was slowly approaching with deafening whistleswas that which having been detached from the train had continuedits route with such terrific rapidity carrying off the unconsciousengineer and stoker  it had run several miles when the fire becominglow for want of fuel the steam had slackened and it had finally stoppedan hour after some twenty miles beyond fort kearney  neither the engineernor the stoker was dead and after remaining for some time in their swoonhad come to themselves  the train had then stopped  the engineer when hefound himself in the desert and the locomotive without cars understoodwhat had happened  he could not imagine how the locomotive had becomeseparated from the train but he did not doubt that the train left behindwas in distresshe did not hesitate what to do  it would be prudent to continueon to omaha for it would be dangerous to return to the trainwhich the indians might still be engaged in pillagingnevertheless he began to rebuild the fire in the furnacethe pressure again mounted and the locomotive returnedrunning backwards to fort kearney  this it was which was whistlingin the mistthe travellers were glad to see the locomotive resume itsplace at the head of the train  they could now continuethe journey so terribly interruptedaouda on seeing the locomotive come up hurried out of the stationand asked the conductor are you going to startat once madambut the prisoners our unfortunate fellowtravellersi cannot interrupt the trip replied the conductorwe are already three hours behind timeand when will another train pass here from san franciscotomorrow evening madamtomorrow evening  but then it will be too late  we must waitit is impossible responded the conductor  if you wish to goplease get ini will not go said aoudafix had heard this conversation  a little while before when therewas no prospect of proceeding on the journey he had made up his mindto leave fort kearney but now that the train was there ready to startand he had only to take his seat in the car an irresistible influenceheld him back  the station platform burned his feet and he could not stirthe conflict in his mind again began anger and failure stifled himhe wished to struggle on to the endmeanwhile the passengers and some of the wounded among themcolonel proctor whose injuries were serious had taken theirplaces in the train  the buzzing of the overheated boiler washeard and the steam was escaping from the valves  the engineerwhistled the train started and soon disappeared minglingits white smoke with the eddies of the densely falling snowthe detective had remained behindseveral hours passed  the weather was dismal and it was very coldfix sat motionless on a bench in the station he might have beenthought asleep  aouda despite the storm kept coming outof the waitingroom going to the end of the platformand peering through the tempest of snow as if to piercethe mist which narrowed the horizon around her and to hearif possible some welcome sound  she heard and saw nothingthen she would return chilled through to issue out againafter the lapse of a few moments but always in vainevening came and the little band had not returned  where could they behad they found the indians and were they having a conflict with themor were they still wandering amid the mist  the commander of the fortwas anxious though he tried to conceal his apprehensionsas night approached the snow fell less plentifullybut it became intensely cold  absolute silence rested on the plainsneither flight of bird nor passing of beast troubled the perfect calmthroughout the night aouda full of sad forebodings her heartstifled with anguish wandered about on the verge of the plainsher imagination carried her far off and showed her innumerable dangerswhat she suffered through the long hours it would be impossible to describefix remained stationary in the same place but did not sleeponce a man approached and spoke to him and the detectivemerely replied by shaking his headthus the night passed  at dawn the halfextinguished disc of the sunrose above a misty horizon  but it was now possible to recognise objectstwo miles off  phileas fogg and the squad had gone southwardin the south all was still vacancy  it was then seven oclockthe captain who was really alarmed did not know what course to takeshould he send another detachment to the rescue of the firstshould he sacrifice more men with so few chances of saving thosealready sacrificed  his hesitation did not last long howevercalling one of his lieutenants he was on the point of orderinga reconnaissance when gunshots were heard  was it a signalthe soldiers rushed out of the fort and half a mile off theyperceived a little band returning in good ordermr fogg was marching at their head and just behind him werepassepartout and the other two travellers rescued from the siouxthey had met and fought the indians ten miles south of fort kearneyshortly before the detachment arrived  passepartout and his companionshad begun to struggle with their captors three of whom the frenchmanhad felled with his fists when his master and the soldiers hastened upto their reliefall were welcomed with joyful cries  phileas fogg distributedthe reward he had promised to the soldiers while passepartoutnot without reason muttered to himself it must certainly beconfessed that i cost my master dearfix without saying a word looked at mr fogg and it would havebeen difficult to analyse the thoughts which struggled within himas for aouda she took her protectors hand and pressed it in her owntoo much moved to speakmeanwhile passepartout was looking about for the train he thoughthe should find it there ready to start for omaha and he hopedthat the time lost might be regainedthe train the train cried hegone replied fixand when does the next train pass here said phileas foggnot till this eveningah returned the impassible gentleman quietlychapter xxxiin which fix the detectiveconsiderably furthers the interests of phileas foggphileas fogg found himself twenty hours behind timepassepartout the involuntary cause of this delay was desperatehe had ruined his masterat this moment the detective approached mr fogg andlooking him intently in the face saidseriously sir are you in great hastequite seriouslyi have a purpose in asking resumed fix  is it absolutelynecessary that you should be in new york on the th before nine oclockin the evening the time that the steamer leaves for liverpoolit is absolutely necessaryand if your journey had not been interrupted by these indiansyou would have reached new york on the morning of the thyes with eleven hours to spare before the steamer leftgood you are therefore twenty hours behind  twelve from twentyleaves eight  you must regain eight hours  do you wish to try to do soon foot asked mr foggno on a sledge replied fix  on a sledge with sailsa man has proposed such a method to meit was the man who had spoken to fix during the night andwhose offer he had refusedphileas fogg did not reply at once but fix having pointed out the manwho was walking up and down in front of the station mr fogg went up to himan instant after mr fogg and the american whose name was mudgeentered a hut built just below the fortthere mr fogg examined a curious vehicle a kind of frame on two long beamsa little raised in front like the runners of a sledge and upon which therewas room for five or six persons  a high mast was fixed on the frame heldfirmly by metallic lashings to which was attached a large brigantine sailthis mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jibsail  behind a sortof rudder served to guide the vehicle  it was in short a sledge riggedlike a sloop  during the winter when the trains are blocked up by the snowthese sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from onestation to another  provided with more sails than a cutter and with the windbehind them they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equalif not superior to that of the express trainsmr fogg readily made a bargain with the owner of this landcraftthe wind was favourable being fresh and blowing from the westthe snow had hardened and mudge was very confident of being ableto transport mr fogg in a few hours to omaha  thence the trainseastward run frequently to chicago and new york  it was not impossiblethat the lost time might yet be recovered and such an opportunitywas not to be rejectednot wishing to expose aouda to the discomforts of travellingin the open air mr fogg proposed to leave her with passepartoutat fort kearney the servant taking upon himself to escort herto europe by a better route and under more favourable conditionsbut aouda refused to separate from mr fogg and passepartoutwas delighted with her decision for nothing could induce himto leave his master while fix was with himit would be difficult to guess the detectives thoughts  was thisconviction shaken by phileas foggs return or did he still regard himas an exceedingly shrewd rascal who his journey round the world completedwould think himself absolutely safe in england  perhaps fixs opinionof phileas fogg was somewhat modified but he was nevertheless resolvedto do his duty and to hasten the return of the whole party to englandas much as possibleat eight oclock the sledge was ready to start  the passengerstook their places on it and wrapped themselves up closelyin their travellingcloaks  the two great sails were hoistedand under the pressure of the wind the sledge slid over the hardenedsnow with a velocity of forty miles an hourthe distance between fort kearney and omaha as the birds flyis at most two hundred miles  if the wind held good the distancemight be traversed in five hours if no accident happened the sledgemight reach omaha by one oclockwhat a journey  the travellers huddled close together could not speakfor the cold intensified by the rapidity at which they were goingthe sledge sped on as lightly as a boat over the waves  when the breezecame skimming the earth the sledge seemed to be lifted off the groundby its sails  mudge who was at the rudder kept in a straight lineand by a turn of his hand checked the lurches which the vehiclehad a tendency to make  all the sails were up and the jibwas so arranged as not to screen the brigantine  a topmast was hoistedand another jib held out to the wind added its force to the other sailsalthough the speed could not be exactly estimated the sledge could notbe going at less than forty miles an hourif nothing breaks said mudge we shall get theremr fogg had made it for mudges interest to reach omahawithin the time agreed on by the offer of a handsome rewardthe prairie across which the sledge was moving in a straightline was as flat as a sea  it seemed like a vast frozen lakethe railroad which ran through this section ascended from thesouthwest to the northwest by great island columbusan important nebraska town schuyler and fremont to omahait followed throughout the right bank of the platte riverthe sledge shortening this route took a chord of the arcdescribed by the railway  mudge was not afraid of being stoppedby the platte river because it was frozen  the road then was quiteclear of obstacles and phileas fogg had but two things to fearan accident to the sledge and a change or calm in the windbut the breeze far from lessening its force blew as if tobend the mast which however the metallic lashings held firmlythese lashings like the chords of a stringed instrumentresounded as if vibrated by a violin bow  the sledge slid alongin the midst of a plaintively intense melodythose chords give the fifth and the octave said mr foggthese were the only words he uttered during the journeyaouda cosily packed in furs and cloaks was shelteredas much as possible from the attacks of the freezing windas for passepartout his face was as red as the suns discwhen it sets in the mist and he laboriously inhaled the biting airwith his natural buoyancy of spirits he began to hope againthey would reach new york on the evening if not on the morningof the th and there was still some chances that it would be beforethe steamer sailed for liverpoolpassepartout even felt a strong desire to grasp his ally fix by the handhe remembered that it was the detective who procured the sledgethe only means of reaching omaha in time but checked by some presentimenthe kept his usual reserve  one thing however passepartout wouldnever forget and that was the sacrifice which mr fogg had madewithout hesitation to rescue him from the sioux  mr fogg had riskedhis fortune and his life no  his servant would never forget thatwhile each of the party was absorbed in reflections so differentthe sledge flew past over the vast carpet of snowthe creeks it passed over were not perceived  fields and streamsdisappeared under the uniform whiteness  the plain was absolutely desertedbetween the union pacific road and the branch which unites kearneywith saint joseph it formed a great uninhabited islandneither village station nor fort appeared  from time to timethey sped by some phantomlike tree whose white skeleton twistedand rattled in the wind  sometimes flocks of wild birds roseor bands of gaunt famished ferocious prairiewolves ran howlingafter the sledge  passepartout revolver in hand held himself readyto fire on those which came too near  had an accident then happenedto the sledge the travellers attacked by these beasts would have beenin the most terrible danger but it held on its even course soon gainedon the wolves and ere long left the howling band at a safe distance behindabout noon mudge perceived by certain landmarks that he wascrossing the platte river  he said nothing but he felt certainthat he was now within twenty miles of omaha  in less than anhour he left the rudder and furled his sails whilst the sledgecarried forward by the great impetus the wind had given itwent on half a mile further with its sails unspreadit stopped at last and mudge pointing to a mass of roofswhite with snow said we have got therearrived  arrived at the station which is in daily communicationby numerous trains with the atlantic seaboardpassepartout and fix jumped off stretched their stiffened limbsand aided mr fogg and the young woman to descend from the sledgephileas fogg generously rewarded mudge whose hand passepartoutwarmly grasped and the party directed their steps to the omaharailway stationthe pacific railroad proper finds its terminus at thisimportant nebraska town  omaha is connected withchicago by the chicago and rock island

from its ruins and more proudly seated than everon the borders of its beautiful lake michigannine hundred miles separated chicago from new york but trainsare not wanting at chicago  mr fogg passed at once from oneto the other and the locomotive of the pittsburgh fort wayneand chicago railway left at full speed as if it fully comprehendedthat that gentleman had no time to lose  it traversed

fogg left the hotel alone after giving passepartout instructionsto await his return and inform aouda to be ready at an instants noticehe proceeded to the banks of the hudson and looked about among the vesselsmoored or anchored in the river for any that were about to departseveral had departure signals and were preparing to put to seaat morning tide for in this immense and admirable port there is not one dayin a hundred that vessels do not set out for every quarter of the globebut they were mostly sailing vessels of which of course phileas foggcould make no usehe seemed about to give up all hope when he espied anchored at the batterya cables length off at most a trading vessel with a screw wellshapedwhose funnel puffing a cloud of smoke indicated that she was getting readyfor departurephileas fogg hailed a boat got into it and soon found himself on boardthe henrietta ironhulled woodbuilt above  he ascended to the deckand asked for the captain who forthwith presented himself  he was a manof fifty a sort of seawolf with big eyes a complexion of oxidised copperred hair and thick neck and a growling voicethe captain asked mr foggi am the captaini am phileas fogg of londonand i am andrew speedy of cardiffyou are going to put to seain an houryou are bound forbordeauxand your cargono freight  going in ballasthave you any passengersno passengers  never have passengers  too much in the wayis your vessel a swift onebetween eleven and twelve knots  the henrietta well knownwill you carry me and three other persons to liverpoolto liverpool  why not to chinai said liverpoolnonono  i am setting out for bordeaux and shall go to bordeauxmoney is no objectnonethe captain spoke in a tone which did not admit of a replybut the owners of the henrietta resumed phileas foggthe owners are myself replied the captain  the vessel belongs to mei will freight it for younoi will buy it of younophileas fogg did not betray the least disappointment but thesituation was a grave one  it was not at new york as at hong kongnor with the captain of the henrietta as with the captain of the tankadereup to this time money had smoothed away every obstacle  now money failedstill some means must be found to cross the atlantic on a boatunless by balloonwhich would have been venturesomebesides not being capable of being put in practiceit seemed that phileas fogg had an idea for he said to the captainwell will you carry me to bordeauxno not if you paid me two hundred dollarsi offer you two thousandapieceapieceand there are four of youfourcaptain speedy began to scratch his head  there were eight thousand dollarsto gain without changing his route for which it was well worth conqueringthe repugnance he had for all kinds of passengers  besides passengersat two thousand dollars are no longer passengers but valuable merchandisei start at nine oclock said captain speedy simply  are you and yourparty readywe will be on board at nine oclock replied no less simply mr foggit was halfpast eight  to disembark from the henrietta jump into a hackhurry to the st nicholas and return with aouda passepartout and eventhe inseparable fix was the work of a brief time and was performed bymr fogg with the coolness which never abandoned him  they were on boardwhen the henrietta made ready to weigh anchorwhen passepartout heard what this last voyage was going to costhe uttered a prolonged oh which extended throughout his vocal gamutas for fix he said to himself that the bank of england would certainlynot come out of this affair well indemnified  when they reached englandeven if mr fogg did not throw some handfuls of bankbills into the seamore than seven thousand pounds would have been spentchapter xxxiiiin which phileas fogg shows himself equal to the occasionan hour after the henrietta passed the lighthouse which marks theentrance of the hudson turned the point of sandy hook and put tosea  during the day she skirted long island passed fire islandand directed her course rapidly eastwardat noon the next day a man mounted the bridge to ascertain thevessels position  it might be thought that this was captain speedynot the least in the world  it was phileas fogg esquireas for captain speedy he was shut up in his cabin under lock and keyand was uttering loud cries which signified an anger at once pardonableand excessivewhat had happened was very simple  phileas fogg wishedto go to liverpool but the captain would not carry him therethen phileas fogg had taken passage for bordeaux and duringthe thirty hours he had been on board had so shrewdly managedwith his banknotes that the sailors and stokers who were onlyan occasional crew and were not on the best terms with the captainwent over to him in a body  this was why phileas fogg was in commandinstead of captain speedy why the captain was a prisoner in his cabinand why in short the henrietta was directing her course towards liverpoolit was very clear to see mr fogg manage the craft that he had been a sailorhow the adventure ended will be seen anon  aouda was anxious though shesaid nothing  as for passepartout he thought mr foggs manoeuvresimply glorious  the captain had said between eleven and twelve knotsand the henrietta confirmed his predictionif thenfor there were ifs stillthe sea did not becometoo boisterous if the wind did not veer round to the eastif no accident happened to the boat or its machinery the henriettamight cross the three thousand miles from new york to liverpoolin the nine days between the th and the st of decemberit is true that once arrived the affair on board the henriettaadded to that of the bank of england might create more difficultiesfor mr fogg than he imagined or could desireduring the first days they went along smoothly enough  the sea wasnot very unpropitious the wind seemed stationary in the northeastthe sails were hoisted and the henrietta ploughed across the waveslike a real transatlantic steamerpassepartout was delighted  his masters last exploit the consequencesof which he ignored enchanted him  never had the crew seen so jollyand dexterous a fellow  he formed warm friendships with the sailorsand amazed them with his acrobatic feats  he thought they managedthe vessel like gentlemen and that the stokers fired up like heroeshis loquacious goodhumour infected everyone  he had forgotten the pastits vexations and delays  he only thought of the end so nearly accomplishedand sometimes he boiled over with impatience as if heated by the furnacesof the henrietta  often also the worthy fellow revolved around fixlooking at him with a keen distrustful eye but he did not speak to himfor their old intimacy no longer existedfix it must be confessed understood nothing of what was going onthe conquest of the henrietta the bribery of the crew fogg managingthe boat like a skilled seaman amazed and confused him  he did not knowwhat to think  for after all a man who began by stealing fiftyfive thousandpounds might end by stealing a vessel and fix was not unnaturally inclinedto conclude that the henrietta under foggs command was not going to liverpoolat all but to some part of the world where the robber turned into a piratewould quietly put himself in safety  the conjecture was at least a plausibleone and the detective began to seriously regret that he had embarkedon the affairas for captain speedy he continued to howl and growl in his cabinand passepartout whose duty it was to carry him his mealscourageous as he was took the greatest precautions  mr foggdid not seem even to know that there was a captain on boardon the th they passed the edge of the banks of newfoundlanda dangerous locality during the winter especially there arefrequent fogs and heavy gales of wind  ever since the eveningbefore the barometer suddenly falling had indicated an approachingchange in the atmosphere and during the night the temperature variedthe cold became sharper and the wind veered to the southeastthis was a misfortune  mr fogg in order not to deviate from his coursefurled his sails and increased the force of the steam but the vessels speedslackened owing to the state of the sea the long waves of which broke againstthe stern  she pitched violently and this retarded her progressthe breeze little by little swelled into a tempest and it was to be fearedthat the henrietta might not be able to maintain herself upright on the wavespassepartouts visage darkened with the skies and for two days the poorfellow experienced constant fright  but phileas fogg was a bold marinerand knew how to maintain headway against the sea and he kept on his coursewithout even decreasing his steam  the henrietta when she could not riseupon the waves crossed them swamping her deck but passing safelysometinies the screw rose out of the water beating its protruding endwhen a mountain of water raised the stern above the waves but the craftalways kept straight aheadthe wind however did not grow as boisterous as might have been fearedit was not one of those tempests which burst and rush on with a speedof ninety miles an hour  it continued fresh but unhappily it remainedobstinately in the southeast rendering the sails uselessthe th of december was the seventyfifth day since phileas foggsdeparture from london and the henrietta had not yet been seriously delayedhalf of the voyage was almost accomplished and the worst localitieshad been passed  in summer success would have been wellnigh certainin winter they were at the mercy of the bad season  passepartoutsaid nothing but he cherished hope in secret and comforted himselfwith the reflection that if the wind failed them they might stillcount on the steamon this day the engineer came on deck went up to mr fogg andbegan to speak earnestly with him  without knowing why it wasa presentiment perhaps passepartout became vaguely uneasyhe would have given one of his ears to hear with the other whatthe engineer was saying  he finally managed to catch a few wordsand was sure he heard his master say you are certain of what you tell mecertain sir replied the engineer  you must remember thatsince we started we have kept up hot fires in all our furnacesand though we had coal enough to go on short steam from new york tobordeaux we havent enough to go with all steam from new york to liverpooli will consider replied mr foggpassepartout understood it all he was seized with mortal anxietythe coal was giving out  ah if my master can get over thatmuttered he hell be a famous man  he could not help impartingto fix what he had overheardthen you believe that we really are going to liverpoolof courseass replied the detective shrugging his shoulders and turning on his heelpassepartout was on the point of vigorously resenting the epithetthe reason of which he could not for the life of him comprehendbut he reflected that the unfortunate fix was probably very muchdisappointed and humiliated in his selfesteem after having soawkwardly followed a false scent around the world and refrainedand now what course would phileas fogg adopt  it was difficultto imagine  nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon onefor that evening he sent for the engineer and said to himfeed all the fires until the coal is exhausteda few moments after the funnel of the henrietta vomited forth torrentsof smoke  the vessel continued to proceed with all steam onbut on the th the engineer as he had predicted announcedthat the coal would give out in the course of the daydo not let the fires go down replied mr foggkeep them up to the last  let the valves be filledtowards noon phileas fogg having ascertained their positioncalled passepartout and ordered him to go for captain speedyit was as if the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tigerhe went to the poop saying to himself he will be like a madmanin a few moments with cries and oaths a bomb appeared on the poopdeckthe bomb was captain speedy  it was clear that he was on the pointof bursting  where are we  were the first words his anger permittedhim to utter  had the poor man be an apoplectic he could never haverecovered from his paroxysm of wrathwhere are we he repeated with purple faceseven hundred and seven miles from liverpoolreplied mr fogg with imperturbable calmnesspirate cried captain speedyi have sent for you sirpickaroonsir continued mr fogg to ask you to sell me your vesselno  by all the devils nobut i shall be obliged to burn herburn the henriettayes at least the upper part of her  the coal has given outburn my vessel cried captain speedy who could scarcelypronounce the words  a vessel worth fifty thousand dollarshere are sixty thousand replied phileas fogg handing thecaptain a roll of bankbills  this had a prodigious effecton andrew speedy  an american can scarcely remain unmovedat the sight of sixty thousand dollars  the captain forgotin an instant his anger his imprisonment and all his grudgesagainst his passenger  the henrietta was twenty years oldit was a great bargain  the bomb would not go off after allmr fogg had taken away the matchand i shall still have the iron hull said the captain in a softer tonethe iron hull and the engine  is it agreedagreedand andrew speedy seizing the banknotes counted themand consigned them to his pocketduring this colloquy passepartout was as white as a sheetand fix seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fitnearly twenty thousand pounds had been expended and foggleft the hull and engine to the captain that isnear the whole value of the craft  it was true howeverthat fiftyfive thousand pounds had been stolen from the bankwhen andrew speedy had pocketed the money mr fogg said to himdont let this astonish you sir  you must know that i shalllose twenty thousand pounds unless i arrive in london bya quarter before nine on the evening of the st of decemberi missed the steamer at new york and as you refused to take me to liverpooland i did well cried andrew speedy for i have gained atleast forty thousand dollars by it  he added more sedatelydo you know one thing captainfoggcaptain fogg youve got something of the yankee about youand having paid his passenger what he considered a high complimenthe was going away when mr fogg said the vessel now belongs to mecertainly from the keel to the truck of the mastsall the wood that isvery well  have the interior seats bunks and frames pulled downand burn themit was necessary to have dry wood to keep the steam upto the adequate pressure and on that day the poop cabinsbunks and the spare deck were sacrificed  on the next daythe th of december the masts rafts and spars were burnedthe crew worked lustily keeping up the fires  passepartout hewed cutand sawed away with all his might  there was a perfect rage for demolitionthe railings fittings the greater part of the deck and top sidesdisappeared on the th and the henrietta was now only a flat hulkbut on this day they sighted the irish coast and fastnet lightby ten in the evening they were passing queenstown  phileas fogghad only twentyfour hours more in which to get to londonthat length of time was necessary to reach liverpool with all steam onand the steam was about to give out altogethersir said captain speedy who was now deeply interested inmr foggs project i really commiserate you  everything isagainst you  we are only opposite queenstownah said mr fogg is that place where we see the lights queenstownyescan we enter the harbournot under three hours  only at high tidestay replied mr fogg calmly without betraying in his featuresthat by a supreme inspiration he was about to attempt once moreto conquer illfortunequeenstown is the irish port at which the transatlantic steamersstop to put off the mails  these mails are carried to dublinby express trains always held in readiness to start from dublinthey are sent on to liverpool by the most rapid boatsand thus gain twelve hours on the atlantic steamersphileas fogg counted on gaining twelve hours in the same wayinstead of arriving at liverpool the next evening by the henriettahe would be there by noon and would therefore have time to reach londonbefore a quarter before nine in the eveningthe henrietta entered queenstown harbour at one oclock in the morningit then being high tide and phileas fogg after being grasped heartilyby the hand by captain speedy left that gentleman on the levelled hulkof his craft which was still worth half what he had sold it forthe party went on shore at once  fix was greatly temptedto arrest mr fogg on the spot but he did not  why  what strugglewas going on within him  had he changed his mind about his mandid he understand that he had made a grave mistake  he did nothowever abandon mr fogg  they all got upon the train which wasjust ready to start at halfpast one at dawn of day they werein dublin and they lost no time in embarking on a steamer whichdisdaining to rise upon the waves invariably cut through themphileas fogg at last disembarked on the liverpool quayat twenty minutes before twelve st december  he was onlysix hours distant from londonbut at this moment fix came up put his hand upon mr foggs shoulderand showing his warrant said you are really phileas foggi ami arrest you in the queens namechapter xxxivin which phileas fogg at last reaches londonphileas fogg was in prison  he had been shut up in the custom houseand he was to he transferred to london the next daypassepartout when he saw his master arrested would havefallen upon fix had he not been held back by some policemenaouda was thunderstruck at the suddenness of an event whichshe could not understand  passepartout explained to her howit was that the honest and courageous fogg was arrested as a robberthe young womans heart revolted against so heinous a chargeand when she saw that she could attempt to do nothing to saveher protector she wept bitterlyas for fix he had arrested mr fogg because it was his dutywhether mr fogg were guilty or notthe thought then struck passepartout that he was the cause of thisnew misfortune  had he not concealed fixs errand from his masterwhen fix revealed his true character and purpose why had he not toldmr fogg  if the latter had been warned he would no doubt have givenfix proof of his innocence and satisfied him of his mistake at leastfix would not have continued his journey at the expense and on the heelsof his master only to arrest him the moment he set foot on english soilpassepartout wept till he was blind and felt like blowing his brains outaouda and he had remained despite the cold under the porticoof the custom house  neither wished to leave the placeboth were anxious to see mr fogg againthat gentleman was really ruined and that at the momentwhen he was about to attain his end  this arrest was fatalhaving arrived at liverpool at twenty minutes beforetwelve on the st of december he had till a quarter before ninethat evening to reach the reform club that is nine hours and a quarterthe journey from liverpool to london was six hoursif anyone at this moment had entered the custom househe would have found mr fogg seated motionless calm and withoutapparent anger upon a wooden bench  he was not it is trueresigned but this last blow failed to force him into an outwardbetrayal of any emotion  was he being devoured by one of thosesecret rages all the more terrible because contained and whichonly burst forth with an irresistible force at the last momentno one could tell  there he sat calmly waitingfor whatdid he still cherish hope  did he still believe now that the doorof this prison was closed upon him that he would succeedhowever that may have been mr fogg carefully put his watchupon the table and observed its advancing hands  not a wordescaped his lips but his look was singularly set and sternthe situation in any event was a terrible one and might bethus stated if phileas fogg was honest he was ruined if hewas a knave he was caughtdid escape occur to him  did he examine to see if there wereany practicable outlet from his prison  did he think of escapingfrom it  possibly for once he walked slowly around the roombut the door was locked and the window heavily barred withiron rods  he sat down again and drew his journal from his pocketon the line where these words were written st decembersaturday liverpool he added th day  am and waitedthe custom house clock struck one  mr fogg observed that his watchwas two hours too fasttwo hours  admitting that he was at this moment taking anexpress train he could reach london and the reform clubby a quarter before nine pm  his forehead slightly wrinkledat thirtythree minutes past two he heard a singular noise outsidethen a hasty opening of doors  passepartouts voice was audibleand immediately after that of fix  phileas foggs eyes brightenedfor an instantthe door swung open and he saw passepartout aouda and fixwho hurried towards himfix was out of breath and his hair was in disorder  he could not speaksir he stammered sirforgive memost unfortunate resemblancerobber arrested three days agoyou are freephileas fogg was free  he walked to the detective looked him steadilyin the face and with the only rapid motion he had ever made in his lifeor which he ever would make drew back his arms and with the precisionof a machine knocked fix downwell hit cried passepartout parbleu thats whatyou might call a good application of english fistsfix who found himself on the floor did not utter a wordhe had only received his deserts  mr fogg aouda and passepartoutleft the custom house without delay got into a cab and in a fewmoments descended at the stationphileas fogg asked if there was an express trainabout to leave for london  it was forty minutes past twothe express train had left thirtyfive minutes beforephileas fogg then ordered a special trainthere were several rapid locomotives on hand but the railway arrangementsdid not permit the special train to leave until three oclockat that hour phileas fogg having stimulated the engineer bythe offer of a generous reward at last set out towards londonwith aouda and his faithful servantit was necessary to make the journey in five hours and a halfand this would have been easy on a clear road throughoutbut there were forced delays and when mr fogg steppedfrom the train at the terminus all the clocks in londonwere striking ten minutes before ninehaving made the tour of the world he was behindhandfive minutes  he had lost the wagerchapter xxxvin which phileas fogg does not have torepeat his orders to passepartout twicethe dwellers in saville row would have been surprised the next dayif they had been told that phileas fogg had returned homehis doors and windows were still closed no appearance of change was visibleafter leaving the station mr fogg gave passepartout instructionsto purchase some provisions and quietly went to his domicilehe bore his misfortune with his habitual tranquillityruined  and by the blundering of the detective  after havingsteadily traversed that long journey overcome a hundred obstaclesbraved many dangers and still found time to do some good on his wayto fail near the goal by a sudden event which he could not have foreseenand against which he was unarmed it was terrible  but a few pounds wereleft of the large sum he had carried with him  there only remainedof his fortune the twenty thousand pounds deposited at baringsand this amount he owed to his friends of the reform clubso great had been the expense of his tour that even had he wonit would not have enriched him and it is probable that he had not soughtto enrich himself being a man who rather laid wagers for honours sakethan for the stake proposed  but this wager totally ruined himmr foggs course however was fully decided upon he knew what remainedfor him to doa room in the house in saville row was set apart for aoudawho was overwhelmed with grief at her protectors misfortunefrom the words which mr fogg dropped she saw that he wasmeditating some serious projectknowing that englishmen governed by a fixed idea sometimes resortto the desperate expedient of suicide passepartout kept a narrow watchupon his master though he carefully concealed the appearance of so doingfirst of all the worthy fellow had gone up to his room and had extinguishedthe gas burner which had been burning for eighty days  he had foundin the letterbox a bill from the gas company and he thought it morethan time to put a stop to this expense which he had been doomed to bearthe night passed  mr fogg went to bed but did he sleepaouda did not once close her eyes  passepartout watchedall night like a faithful dog at his masters doormr fogg called him in the morning and told him to getaoudas breakfast and a cup of tea and a chop for himselfhe desired aouda to excuse him from breakfast and dinneras his time would be absorbed all day in putting his affairs to rightsin the evening he would ask permission to have a few momentsconversation with the young ladypassepartout having received his orders had nothing to do but obey themhe looked at his imperturbable master and could scarcely bring his mindto leave him  his heart was full and his conscience tortured by remorsefor he accused himself more bitterly than ever of being the causeof the irretrievable disaster  yes if he had warned mr foggand had betrayed fixs projects to him his master would certainlynot have given the detective passage to liverpool and thenpassepartout could hold in no longermy master  mr fogg he cried why do you not curse meit was my fault thati blame no one returned phileas fogg with perfect calmness  gopassepartout left the room and went to find aoudato whom he delivered his masters messagemadam he added i can do nothing myselfnothingi have no influence over my master but you perhapswhat influence could i have replied aouda  mr foggis influenced by no one  has he ever understood that my gratitudeto him is overflowing  has he ever read my heart  my friendhe must not be left alone an instant  you say he is going tospeak with me this eveningyes madam probably to arrange for your protection and comfort in englandwe shall see replied aouda becoming suddenly pensivethroughout this day sunday the house in saville row was as if uninhabitedand phileas fogg for the first time since he had lived in that housedid not set out for his club when westminster clock struck halfpast elevenwhy should he present himself at the reform  his friends no longer expectedhim there  as phileas fogg had not appeared in the saloon on theevening before saturday the st of december at a quarter before ninehe had lost his wager  it was not even necessary that he should go tohis bankers for the twenty thousand pounds for his antagonists alreadyhad his cheque in their hands and they had only to fill it outand send it to the barings to have the amount transferred to their creditmr fogg therefore had no reason for going out and sohe remained at home  he shut himself up in his roomand busied himself putting his affairs in orderpassepartout continually ascended and descended the stairsthe hours were long for him he listened at his masters doorand looked through the keyhole as if he had a perfect right so to doand as if he feared that something terrible might happen at any momentsometimes he thought of fix but no longer in anger  fix like allthe world had been mistaken in phileas fogg and had only done his dutyin tracking and arresting him while he passepartout   this thought haunted him and he never ceased cursing his miserable follyfinding himself too wretched to remain alone he knocked at aoudas doorwent into her room seated himself without speaking in a cornerand looked ruefully at the young woman aouda was still pensiveabout halfpast seven in the evening mr fogg sent to knowif aouda would receive him and in a few moments he found himselfalone with herphileas fogg took a chair and sat down near the fireplaceopposite aouda  no emotion was visible on his facefogg returned was exactly the fogg who had gone awaythere was the same calm the same impassibilityhe sat several minutes without speaking then bending his eyes on aoudamadam said he will you pardon me for bringing you to englandi mr fogg replied aouda checking the pulsations of her heartplease let me finish returned mr fogg  when i decided tobring you far away from the country which was so unsafe for youi was rich and counted on putting a portion of my fortuneat your disposal then your existence would have been free and happybut

new wagers were made  phileas foggs name was once moreat a premium on changehis five friends of the reform club passed these three days ina state of feverish suspense  would phileas fogg whom they hadforgotten reappear before their eyes  where was he at this momentthe th of december the day of james strands arrestwas the seventysixth since phileas foggs departureand no news of him had been received  was he deadhad he abandoned the effort or was he continuing his journeyalong the route agreed upon  and would he appear on saturdaythe st of december at a quarter before nine in the eveningon the threshold of the reform club saloonthe anxiety in which for three days london society existedcannot be described  telegrams were sent to america and asiafor news of phileas fogg  messengers were dispatched to the housein saville row morning and evening  no news  the police wereignorant what had become of the detective fix who had sounfortunately followed up a false scent  bets

established around the reform club  circulationwas impeded and everywhere disputes discussions and financialtransactions were going on  the police had great difficulty inkeeping back the crowd and as the hour when phileas foggwas due approached the excitement rose to its highest pitchthe five antagonists of phileas fogg had met in the great saloon of the clubjohn sullivan and samuel fallentin the bankers andrew stuart the engineergauthier ralph the director of the bank of england and thomas flanaganthe brewer one and all waited anxiouslywhen the clock indicated twenty minutes past eight andrew stuart got upsaying gentlemen in twenty minutes the time agreed upon between mr foggand ourselves will have expiredwhat time did the last train arrive from liverpool  asked thomas flanaganat twentythree minutes past seven replied gauthier ralphand the next does not arrive till ten minutes after twelvewell gentlemen resumed andrew stuart if phileas fogghad come in the  train he would have got here by this timewe can therefore regard the bet as wonwait dont let us be too hasty replied samuel fallentinyou know that mr fogg is very eccentric  his punctualityis well known he never arrives too soon or too late and ishould not be surprised if he appeared before us at the last minutewhy said andrew stuart nervously if i should see himi should not believe it was hethe fact is resumed thomas flanagan mr foggs projectwas absurdly foolish  whatever his punctuality he could notprevent the delays which were certain to occur and a delayof only two or three days would be fatal to his

partners suspended their game  they left their cardsand counted the secondsat the fortieth second nothing  at the fiftieth still nothingat the fiftyfifth a loud cry was heard in the streetfollowed by applause hurrahs and some fierce growlsthe players rose from their seatsat the fiftyseventh second the door of the saloon openedand the pendulum had not beat the sixtieth second whenphileas fogg appeared followed by an excited crowdwho had forced their way through the club doorsand in his calm voice said here i am gentlemenchapter xxxviiin which it is shown that phileas fogg gained nothing by histour around the world unless it were happinessyes phileas fogg in personthe reader will remember that at five minutes past eight in the eveningabout five and twenty hours after the arrival of the travellers in londonpassepartout had been sent by his master to engage the services ofthe reverend samuel wilson in a certain marriage ceremonywhich was to take place the next daypassepartout went on his errand enchanted  he soonreached the clergymans house but found him not at homepassepartout waited a good twenty minutes and when he leftthe reverend gentleman it was thirtyfive minutes past eightbut in what a state he was  with his hair in disorderand without his hat he ran along the street as never manwas seen to run before overturning passersbyrushing over the sidewalk like a waterspoutin three minutes he was in saville row againand staggered back into mr foggs roomhe could not speakwhat is the matter asked mr foggmy master gasped passepartoutmarriageimpossibleimpossibleimpossiblefor tomorrowwhy sobecause tomorrowis sundaymonday replied mr foggnotoday is saturdaysaturday  impossibleyes yes yes yes cried passepartout  you have made a mistakeof one day  we arrived twentyfour hours ahead of timebut there are only ten minutes leftpassepartout had seized his master by the collarand was dragging him along with irresistible forcephileas fogg thus kidnapped without having time to thinkleft his house jumped into a cab promised a hundred poundsto the cabman and having run over two dogs and overturnedfive carriages reached the reform clubthe clock indicated a quarter before nine when he appearedin the great saloonphileas fogg had accomplished the journey round the world in eighty daysphileas fogg had won his wager of twenty thousand poundshow was it that a man so exact and fastidious could have madethis error of a day  how came he to think that he had arrivedin london on saturday the twentyfirst day of decemberwhen it was really friday the twentieth the seventyninth dayonly from his departurethe cause of the error is very simplephileas fogg had without suspecting it gained one day on his journeyand this merely because he had travelled constantly eastward he wouldon the contrary have lost a day had he gone in the opposite directionthat is westwardin journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun and the days thereforediminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed degreesin this direction  there are three hundred and sixty degreeson the circumference of the earth and these three hundred and sixty degreesmultiplied by four minutes gives precisely twentyfour hoursthat isthe day unconsciously gained  in other words while phileas fogggoing eastward saw the sun pass the meridian eighty timeshis friends in london only saw it pass the meridian seventynine timesthis is why they awaited him at the reform club on saturdayand not sunday as mr fogg thoughtand passepartouts famous family watch which had always kept london timewould have betrayed this fact if it had marked the days as well asthe hours and the minutesphileas fogg then had won the twenty thousand pounds butas he had spent nearly nineteen thousand on the way the pecuniarygain was small  his object was however to be victoriousand not to win money  he divided the one thousand poundsthat remained between passepartout and the unfortunate fixagainst whom he cherished no grudge  he deducted howeverfrom passepartouts share the cost of the gas which had burnedin his room for nineteen hundred and twenty hoursfor the sake of regularitythat evening mr fogg as tranquil and phlegmatic as eversaid to aouda is our marriage still agreeable to youmr fogg replied she it is for me to ask that questionyou were

apprisedof my error anddear mr fogg said the young womandear aouda replied phileas foggit need not be said that the marriage took place fortyeight hours afterand that passepartout glowing and dazzling gave the bride awayhad he not saved her and was he not entitled to this honourthe next day as soon as it was light passepartout rappedvigorously at his masters door  mr fogg opened it and askedwhats the matter passepartoutwhat is it sir  why ive just this instant found outwhatthat we might have made the tour of the world in only seventyeight daysno doubt returned mr fogg by not crossing india  but ifi had not crossed india i should not have saved aoudashe would not have been my wife andmr fogg quietly shut the doorphileas fogg had won his wager and had made his journeyaround the world in eighty days  to do this he had employedevery means of conveyancesteamers railways carriages yachtstradingvessels sledges elephants  the eccentric gentlemanhad throughout displayed all his marvellous qualities of coolnessand exactitude  but what then  what had he really gained by allthis trouble  what had he brought back from this long and weary journeynothing say you  perhaps so nothing but a
